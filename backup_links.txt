I come from Sydney and the disaster that was apparently unfolding with the Sydney Olympics was a big let down as the games ran not only smoothly, but were apparently "the best games ever". Before Beijing, people where going to die from smog inhalation. Sadly not many suffered. Sochi was supposed to be a remake of the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Yet no race of super human Russians stepped up to the plate to bring a world war.

It's hard to imagine you could let brand new buildings rot so fast. And this was during a period where they were receiving significant EU subsidies.

Maybe the Olympics should be held in Greece, but managed by Germans or something. I don't have much confidence in the IOC's decision making wisdom.$I completely agree simply because of the horror stories I've heard about the creation of new Olympic sites. It seems like every nation spends tons of money creating a site, then never really breaks even $Olympics traditionally cost the hosting country FAR more than they earn back.$No, I don't think the onus should be on one country.  I think there should be designated cities who have already hosted that are on a rotating roster to hold the games. There would be an official process to appoint these cities. For example one from each continent at least. Same for Winter Olympics. That way we can minimise the stress of picking a city and having that country go bankrupt trying to build the infrastructure. And upcoming athletes can be assured they're going some place that knows what's it's doing. I'm not saying this is a perfect solution but I think it's a decent one.$>viral

This doesn't mean the older you get the happier you get, it only means old people are happy and young people aren't happy. 

Old people are happy because they grew up in the most prosperous economic times and are retired. Meanwhile millennials are swimming in debt and too poor to afford rent/mortgage/student debt/car loans/utilities/clothes/dining out/groceries/running water/bath soap/shelter/the bare necessities of life/etc

So depending on other factors the question really becomes do you have the time available to do the teaching. 

Are you a single parent working 60+ hours a week? Possibly with multiple kids.  You probably won't notice and the kid will eventually learn on his own. 

Is it a comfortable 2 parent home with one person working for the whole family?  That kid will probably get taught. 

Is it a struggling 2 Parent home with both parents working a lot.  Then it will probably get taken away from him. So they can focus on more important things. 

Then you factor in the kid,  is he/she a glue eating asshole, hard headed, and stubborn? Out maybe awesome and listens and learns from others well?  Probably somewhere in between. 

TL;DR parenting is a big bunch of choices and priorities and different depending on the situation AND the kids.   And it's hard as fuck and there's no right answer.  

Edit: to answer the question.  Yes it's possible.  

But do you have the energy and time to spend on it? $"These are some pretty neat ShhhhhhhHHHHHHHHHHHOOOOOOOKKH MY GOD CHARLIE IS HIDING IN THE SHOOOOOOEEEEEEEESSSSS!"$> IT'S ARMED!

Where's that from?$*fewer$http://i.imgur.com/F4bxMX6$>don't worry millennials ...you'll continue being unhappy later in life as well. 

Thank god! I would hate to have to cope with the change. $Youre right. All of those 95 year olds are content with all of their pleasant memories of the Great Depression. $>Old people are happy because they grew up in the most prosperous economic times and are retired.   
  
While that may be true for Baby Boomers (now in their 70s), old folks now in their 90s grew up during The Great Depression. $That's far from certain.  Young people in general tend to struggle more than older people financially.  This has always been the case.  When you're young your earning power is lower, and you tend to lack the experience to make sound financial decisions.  You also lack life experience in general, and that tends to coincide with a lack of confidence in many aspects of life.  These things tend to (hopefully) mitigate as you get older.  Yes, the state of the larger economy these days makes it tough, but for the majority of people it's still likely to get better as they get older.  

My early earning years were primarily during the post-dot-com and post-9/11 economic slump, then I got hit by the 2008 meltdown as well, but I'm doing better now.  I can say unequivocally that I'm happier now at 39 than I was in my 20s, and it's only partially economic.  I still have a lot of debt from that era, but I'm more comfortable in my own skin, and I have more confidence that I'm in a decent spot financially, and if something really shitty happens again that I'll be able to deal with it.$You're grouping a large group of people into one category. There's plenty of millennials that are very happy and without debt. $And now I'm sadder :($There's also the part where older individuals have lived through plenty of things and get a bit wiser about what is worth stressing over and what isn't. Meanwhile the younger individuals worry about the strangest things sometimes. Yes, times are tough and there's plenty to stress about (like affordable housing, proper wages, medical), but there are a lot of things that seriously aren't worth freaking out over too.

$Actually not neccesarily true the "unhappy" are generally pessimistic and will prepare more compared to the happy and optimistic. $This for me, as well.  I'm happier because I'm way better at solving the problems life throws at me than when I was younger, not because I have less stressors in my life.  I'm also better at enjoying life and making the most of my time.  I spent my youth glued to video games.  I spend my adulthood glued to video games in a way nicer chair and with frequent breaks for outdoorsy stuff. But mostly video games.$But at least now I can afford to medicate my soul crushing depression with Amazon prime orders. $Being a social outcast with disposable income is a much improved position. Now I can pay people to pretend to be my friends!$I think It's just kind of backwards once you leave college.

I feel like the big difference is that in college, you were at least pretty guaranteed to have plenty of people with _something_ in common, with whom you spent your days; if you made even a little effort, you could find someone in your classes to sit with and chat about whatever.  With work, there's no such guarantee, and that can make the days drag on, but the money you get to spend on your free time makes it more rewarding than when you were in college and didn't have as much freedom or spending money.


Side note to college graduates: I'm 25 and the youngest guy in my office by about fifteen years. The money's pretty good, but my god the small talk is nothing but grandkids, couponing, and the same tired out work puns week after week.  Make sure that wherever you end up is somewhere you'll _enjoy_ working; don't just take the first place that offers what you're willing to pay. You're probably going to give this place several years of your life, if not more, so make sure you'll enjoy it.$Everyone loves to complain about their job, but I sit here and reddit for a few hours a day, I make okay money, and I can probably go other places with my experience. I get up to get coffee or go to the bathroom when I need and no one bothers me and most of my coworkers are at least tolerable. $I mean, I still hate my job, but I'm happier than I was. I have a lot more freedoms as an adult, and I feel like I have some control over my trajectory, and a hope of moving forward.
 
I also don't have to feel like I'm constantly being challenged to learn new things - I can actually take time to get good at what I'm doing before having new shit thrown my way. $I once asked an elderly pt "how do you feel" "Eh?"  I repeated 3 more times, getting progressively louder. On the last "how do you feel?!?" practically screamed in his face. He wriggled his fingers at me, "with my hands!" With a twinkle in his eye.$Awww, that's so adorable! When I was doing CNA work I had one old lady who would always remind me to put her "pampers" on her before bed.$Used to work in a dining room of a retirement home. The job sucked but the little old people were a delight! So many highlights. One couple were planning pretty intricately the ins and outs of a marijuana operation. They had a spot picked out on the grounds, were putting others in charge of distribution and sale, and offered to give another server and I a cut if we kept it on the down low.$I think a part of it is that as our children come into their own as adults, we feel much less pressure to be role models and examples. As a result, we let the guard down a bit more and allow them to see our inner child a lot more often.$I thought he was referring to his style specifically. People tend to stick to theirs, so when you're old nobody really cares because "it was probably cool back then" or something. Thing is, when others weren't around to know that's not really the case, you can get away with more...

Bonus story: I was in the Opryland Mall in Nashville and that place has nice smooth floors and a bunch of handicap ramps. I started at one end of the mall and I started hitting those little ramps.

What are those?!" And I reply "Kid's shoes with wheels in them." And he says "That's really neat and all but I can't have you flying around in here like that!"

Yes, being well rounded is important (in interests, not appearance). For me I hated driving, so when I moved to a city where I didn't need a car I ditched it and just kept my bicycles. When I am out cycling I bring a notebook around to write down ideas (UX design, data science stuff, etc) and take photos. Doing what I love is actually the only reason I am not any fatter. When people exert themselves physically they have dopamine released, so it is likely that finding something to do will not make them fat. There are even professional gamers not fat, so meh.

The wheels could be popped back inside the shoe entirely in just a couple of seconds. There was like a hollow platform area around the base of the shoe that made the space for them to go inside. [Kinda like this](https://res.cloudinary.com/keep/image/fetch/t_post_large,f_auto/https://s3.amazonaws.com/production-ol-images/86a5048cc821e857af2653666712bc40.jpg).

I could go from walking shoe to full on skating in seconds without removing the shoes. I was so sad when I outgrew them - I had even bought them one size up from my normal size thinking I wouldn't outgrow a size 8 (UK), ended up being a size 10 (UK; USA equivalent is Men's 11 I think) by the age of 12 which is just freaky for a female - they don't make women's shoes past size 9 here and most shops only carry up to 8s. Had to spend the rest of my life in men's boots and converse, sadly, all wheeless. If anyone knows where to get another pair like that please tell me - was hard enough tracking down a picture that was similar. $For real. Changing those wheels to the inserts was harder than changing the tire of a car.

plus, I think losing one of those inserts is part of being a heelys owner.#

But does anyone else possibly see Muriel from *Courage the Cowardly Dog*?$Last year I spent about $75 on buying full sized candy bars. I was gonna be that cool guy. I had on my Jedi robes and everything. My dog was dressed up, too.
The next day I had about $75 worth of full sized candy bars to myself. First time living in an apartment complex on my own, didn't realize that wasn't a thing.

Edit 2: Some of you guys were fooled by my doggo's costume. [Here he is out of it.](http://imgur.com/a/QsWEG)$It'll still be reposted. $Too late. It's already been reposted. Yesterday and 2 days ago.

;)

$One of my favourites, thanks for (re)posting, and thanks for your great cartoons!  
 $Whatever you say snickers PR team $I know this'll likely get buried, but my grandmother (also named Margaret) used to love Halloween. She loved seeing all the kids dressed up and giving them candy. She'd joke about being a witch and flying on her broom. 

A few years ago in the fall she was very sick and on hospice with liver failure. She held on for longer than anyone expected. We decorated for Halloween and took pictures of the costumes so we could show her, even though she was already so far gone that she was mostly unresponsive. So we "showed" her the pictures of the costumes as the kids came and went and had a quiet Halloween at her house. She passed the next day. This comic strip just feels so perfect. $I reference this in real life way more often than I should. Congrats man$Especially relevant this year.  That clown is creepy.$REPOS....Ok, never mind, carry on.$First time I've seen it. Here's a full sized upvote$She does look like a Margaret. Is there a Margaret who inspired her?$My name is Margaret. I've been sent this comic countless times because of you $So what brings you to reddit OP?$"Full-size Snickers bar, bam! Who does that?! Who does that?! Nobody! Nobody! I'll break your fucking bag with my candy." $Did the Grim Reapear just curse in front of those kids?$This one's my favorite of yours :)$My favorite! It's not officially Halloween til you see this on the interwebs. 

And it's been in my camera roll from the first time I saw it so I can send it to my best friend (Margaret) every year and remind her to keep some full sized bars around. It's her favorite too! $Thought they like apples$It was the year 2008, the economic recession was at full fling, and Margret lost her job at the snickers factory. Desolated by this and in fear of trying to make ends meet as well as make Death's deadline on Halloween, she tried selling everything, but just couldn't get enough. Finally the day came, she got on her knees and begged Death to not take her away, for she has grandkids that love her, a family that will miss her, and a neighborhood that will miss her delicious snickers, but she could tell Death wasn't having any of this. She turned to her last option, a dark one, she begged to Death to instead take away her family and friends, and that she would double the snickers output next year, but that obviously didn't work. Finally death took action, he reached into his pocket, pulled out a snickers and gave it to the helpless broken Margret, and said "Eat a snickers, you aren't you when your hungry", then swiped his hand over her and took her soul to the afterlife, thus the story of Margret ends here$Yay credit for the op$This is awesome. Saw it last year and posted it on my Facebook. Had no idea where it originated. Link to more of your work?$An all time classic.$Is Margaret related to Muriel from Courage?$lol love those little kids. you should make cartoons of just them - too adorbs I could eat them up!$I love this so much.  I enjoy it every time it's posted.$HEY THAT'S MY REPOST!!!$Good to see an actual content creator posting their own stuff. Fuck karma whores, mad props.$This comic along with the squirrel one of yours are phenomenal. Keep it up. 

[Squirrel comic which also takes place at Margaret's house] (http://i.imgur.com/TeRt2qG.png)$Howd this go from 12k to 7k$Although I have historically downvoted every repost I have seen, I love this cartoon and thus give it an upvote. $Wow, it is so cool and genuine when the creator shares his goodies$I love this one. You hit the exact right tone, bang on the head -- really great work.$This is one of my all time favorite cartoons.  Thanks for putting it back up!$My 90 year old grandma always gave out full-size Snickers on Halloween. Now I know how she lived so long. I don't think she gives out candy in the retirement home, though.$Hey JimKB, thanks for this toon. It's one my favorites for Halloween and I repost the hell out of it to my friends. Cheers!$I love your work$Knew what it was - and was really glad to see it again. And will be next year.$Funny how 90% of the posts that get "re-posted" to Reddit are things I've never seen before. Exactly how much time do people spend on here? $Hi! I'm probably too late for you to find my comment buried under everything, but I just wanted to say thanks for creating Happy Bunny and Dear Dumb Diary and for making my parents worried that I would become too sassy. $See you next year!$I literally just reposted this on IG. I did credit you though. $Jim Benton ur my hero$And as long as this keeps getting reposted she will keep living $Margaret looks so happy :)$Wow, I'm so used to [this internet](http://www.picturesinboxes.com/2014/01/01/internet/) I didn't know OP made actual OC.$I love this, I never knew who made it, do you have any more comics?$Hate to burst your bubble Jimbo, but I've seen this reposted already this year.

...still funny though$Up vote for legitimate OP$Can't believe that works on him every year$I friggin' love this pic (and enjoy it every time it's reposted). Everybody loves full-size bars! Glad to see the original artist getting some recognition!$Okay, don't hate me but am I the only one who never found this comic funny and don't even know why it's so popular. Dude, I love some of your other comics and don't mean to hate on you but what's Reddit's obsession with this comic?!$Nice try snickers company$And this is why there is that saying from the old country.

Keep a bowl of full sized snickers near the door Incase death comes a knocking.
$I for one am glad you reposted this, as I have never seen this before.$It is a great cartoon dude$Hey man, I really enjoy your cartoons.  [
This one](http://www.jimbenton.com/page14/files/JimBentonComic-Nothing.html) reminds me of [Saul Steinberg](http://www.hoodedutilitarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/steinberg_11251961.gif).$Oh man I love this one..makes me laugh everytime ..thank you $I'm pretty sure that death has learned by now that Halloween missions are futile. $It is good that Margaret stay alive.  If she went to Heaven, she would  make every one a gluttony sinner.  If she went to Hell, she would make it bearable for the sinners.$You made this? I made this. $Margaret now dating Paul Edgecomb but tired of the same shitty stories about the Green Mile. $Makes me smile every damn time it comes around too.$I've loved this comic for a long time. I always imagine the version of Grim from Billy and Mandy having this conversation.$That's bribery, margaret.
$Upvote for a repost$I see this comic every year now in October and I love it aha, great work man!$[deleted]$Rightly so I love this comic. $Read that in Norm McDonald's voice.$I've actually never seen this before.

SAVED THE WORLD AND ALL, NOW GET IN THE BAG!$UP THE SHUT FUCK. BAG!$I liked little Muriel but she was a handful$[deleted]$We lived in a condo (limited/no traffic to our door as we lived on the top floor) before buying our house and we were woefully unprepared for the tide of children that swept over our poor front lawn.  I was handing out individually wrapped vitamin gumballs while my wife frantically tried to make it to the store to buy whatever candy they had left just so we wouldn't be the house that got 'decorated' later.

Knock wood, 10 years later and we are still TP/Egg free.$One of the coolest halloween experiences I've had was in a court/culdesac. All of the houses came together to make a haunted neighbourhood type thing, and it was the greatest idea ever. The place was filled, and the atmosphere was as Halloween-y as you can get.

It would catch the eye of everyone who walked by the court, so people would always check it out.

You should get together with your neighbours and do the same.

$I feel your pain. Our house is on a little side street. We were so excited for tick-or-treaters. The pizza guy got lots of candy.$After years of being snubbed by the kiddos and becoming quite disillusioned about the whole thing, i decided to take matters into my own hands. Granted, we were in a better neighborhood by this point, but no matter. We lined up five carved pumpkins on the porch, laced it with webs and all the other accoutrements of Halloween, left the porch light on and the door open, blasting the Halloween Pandora station toward the street for all to hear and know: this was the fucking spot. Not only were all of the residents dressed up, but so was the dog, and yes, we had full sized bars that were *not* going to be eaten by me this time. Sure enough we had a line of kids around the corner of the house. 

TL;DR - Treat it like you're the witch in Hansel & Gretel; you must lure the children in (but don't bake them, that will seriously hinder your turnout the following year). $Sounds like this year you need some banners that says "Full size bars." Get some spots on those suckers. Maybe get a color guard to march up and down to the main street, spinning and tossing the banners. 

What im saying is stop half assing this.  $When my ex and I lived together, we lived in the "not as nice part of town" Which translates to "not brand new houses in the suburbs." The city would literally pick kids up on buses and take them to the newer ritzy part of the city. I had a whole big bowl of candy ready to rock. Only got 1 group of 4 teenagers the whole night. I told them to take as much as they wanted. They emptied that bowl clean. I at least got to make a few kid's nights. The next year I didn't even bother which sucked but it is what it is. $I had my first trickertreaters last year after 5 years of living in my house.  The first three years I was certain that "this year is the year."  Finally I got tired of the self-loating that came with eating a whole thing of Halloween candy.

Then last year I had my first two tricker-treaters.  I was totally unprepared.  I gave them each a lemon-lime sodawater, and I gave their dad a beer.$No it's just s female dog$Clearly a shark$How can you be so insensitive to what is clearly a dog that has autism.

This particular quote is from Thud! which was the 30-something-th book.  There's separate distinct series within discworld.  This is from "The Watch" series, and I think it's the 6/7/8th book in that series (IIRC).$Yeah, as the other people said, it's fantastic and you need to read them. 

The joke there is that Death speaks in all caps, no quotes. For example, this is a conversation from one of the books:

>WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

>’Uh,’ said Mort. ‘Mortimer...sir. They call me Mort.’ 

>WHAT A COINCIDENCE, said the skull. 

$This particular quote is from *Thud!*.  Someone else posted the "suggested reading order."  There is a lot of crossover cameo stuff, and even within a single "line" you wouldn't have to read the books in order, but I'd recommend you do.

*Thud!* is maybe my favorite Pratchett.  Sam Vimes is definitely my favorite discworld character.

If you're looking for not that much of a commitment, I would also recommend *Small Gods* and the Moist books, *Going Postal*, *Making Money*, and *Raising Steam*.  But if you're willing to read them all, the guards books are through and through my favorites.$Yep. [Here's the reading order guide](http://www.lspace.org/books/reading-order-guides/the-discworld-reading-order-guide-20.jpg). I recommend you start with "Guards!

That's not my cow!$I prefer the witches over Rincewind, not to say that the wizard books aren't great too.$My favorites too! Everyone else I've spoken to seems to prefer the Watch, but I just love Rincewind's cowardice and being-in-the-wrong-place-at-the-right-timeness so much.$While I love those books as a Pratchett fan, I'd not recommend them to a new reader unless they're already familiar with fantasy as a genre (especially 60s and 70s, his early books are very much a genre parody and that kind of requires at least familiarity with the genre.    

Hell I'd go so far as to say colour of magic is by far his worst book, it's a book that sets up a lot of great ideas better used in further books, but really isn't that good taken as a standalone work. It's like Mozart's early works, interesting especially if you really like Mozart - but frankly just not very good.  

As they're all pretty much stand alone books (even books in a particular series) I'd start with one of his absolute best.

Night Watch.

It's a simple story, with great characters that isn't too "fantasy". It's basically police drama with political overtones. Doesn't have any required reading, it's not too whimsical - and while I love my discworld whimsey it is an acquired taste. It's got funny moments but is serious when it should be and while it contains minor spoilers to past books they're only evident as spoilers when you read the actual books and go "oh that's why..." so they're more schrodingers-spoilers.

~~Thief of time~~ [Edit changed my mind] Wyrd Sisters would be my second recommendation for someone fluent in fantasy novels but has never read Pratchett.

(The Last Continent, FourEcks, being a joke about Australia)

Death held out a hand. I WANT, he said, A BOOK ABOUT THE DANGEROUS CREATURES OF FOURECKS-

Albert looked up and dived for cover, receiving only mild bruising because he had the foresight to curl into a ball.

After a while Death, his voice a little muffled, said: ALBERT, I WOULD BE SO GRATEFUL IF YOU COULD GIVE ME A HAND HERE.

Albert scrambled up and pulled at some of the huge volumes, finally dislodging enough of them for his master to clamber free.

HMM... Death picked up a book at random and read the cover. "DANGEROUS MAMMALS, REPTILES, AMPHIBIANS, BIRDS, FISH, JELLYFISH, INSECTS, SPIDERS, CRUSTACEANS, GRASSES, TREES, MOSSES, AND LICHENS OF TERROR INCOGNITA, " he read. His gaze moved down the spine. VOLUME 29C, he added. OH. PART THREE, I SEE.

He glanced up at the listening shelves. POSSIBLY IT WOULD BE SIMPLER IF I ASKED FOR A LIST OF THE HARMLESS CREATURES OF THE AFORESAID CONTINENT?

They waited.

IT WOULD APPEAR THAT-

"No, wait master. Here it comes."

Albert pointed to something white zigzagging lazily through the air. Finally Death reached up an caught the single sheet of paper.

He read it carefully and then turned it over briefly just in case anything was written on the other side.

"May I?" said Albert. Death handed him the paper.

"'Some of the sheep, '" Albert read aloud. "Oh, well. Maybe a week at the seaside'd be better, then."

WHAT AN INTRIGUING PLACE, said Death. SADDLE UP THE HORSE, ALBERT. I FEEL SURE I'M GOING TO BE NEEDED.$All of them then? I agree!$Ok so from a quick Google there are a lot of them and no numbering?

It's not necessarily bad - I think, to an extent, there's something inside of us that, mixed in with our natural curiosity, makes us want to help each other when we expect something negative is about to happen. We're instinctively driven to try to see and understand what's dangerous around is for the purpose of eliminating that danger. Then again, maybe that's a bit of an optimistic view.

Even it's simple morbid curiosity that drives us, I don't think it's inherently watch to watch this, as long as we're sufficiently exposed to all sides of whatever news is being brought. That's the key to really getting the best out of whatever news you hear about.

And as such, in a time when emotions are pretty high-strung and people are on the edge, it's important to be able to respect your fellow man and woman enough to hear and empathize with their point of view.

You don’t want to act, or even talk, alone; you don’t want to ‘go out of your way to make trouble.’ Why not?—Well, you are not in the habit of doing it.

The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed.

The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.

$> Is this how Republicans/Conservatives have felt the past 8 years? Waking up every day wondering how badly the President has screwed up?

I doubt it, to be honest. Some of them might have genuinely believed that Obama was going to implement death panels or whatever, but for most of them, life pretty much went on as normal.$Yup. Pretty much. The first two years were hell. The Democrats were constantly reminding us that we had lost and had no power to stop them, how "Historic" every action was. But it wasn't just the politics that got so out of hand, it was society that started to morph.

Slowly we were being silenced on campus, forced to take college classes to tell us how bad we were. Divisive rhetoric was forced on us, the progressive stack was implemented. Conservative speakers were being dis-invited with no recourse. I'm sure you've wondered how the heck Pao, Milo, and Brietbart blew up the way they did... it's because of the suppression Conservatives silently faced the past 8 years. The constant tightening of the screws as identity politics seemed to take over. The way the media ignored real grievances to continue the narrative of "wrong side of history" conservatives and the constant fawning over Obama.

This is the release valve on all of that. The media have remembered they're supposed to have a backbone. The President is reversing the course on many issues that were ignored by the previous administration. We're a week in on a pendulum correction and already everyone is overreacting like it's the end of the world.$FADA (bill that will allow discrimination against LGBTQ) is probably coming this week...ugh.$When will it end?

Thems prime tweetin' hours. $Two reasons: 1) people who make their money off hating on conservatives don't really have a lot of ammo during a democratic presidency. 2) he's the only liberal comedian I have seen who coherently makes fun of Trump for his policies and does so in both a funny AND logical way. So many of these comedians are taking the lazy way and just saying "Trump is dumb" for cheap laughs, but Maher is actually saying "here is is policy, here's why it's wrong, here's a funny punchline relevant to what I just said."$More like an eternity of this. I fear Trump will introduce martial law and get rid of the 22nd amendment in order to stay in power forever. 

As a Filipino, we already know what it's like to have someone like Ferdinand Marcos in power for 20 years, who also declared martial law in 1972 in order to stay in power. It took us until 1986, 21 years into his presidency, to stand up to him and overthrow him with a peaceful and bloodless revolution.

Fun Fact: [This was the (retroactive) anthem of the EDSA revolution of 1986.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooGtSV7UafI) The song is called "Handog ng Pilipino sa Mundo", which translates out to "The Gift of the Filipinos to the World". The lyrics of the refrain tell the story of how Filipinos will always fight for truth, freedom, and justice, and that we'll do it without any violence as long as we are all united.$No I don't think so.

Quebec (Canada... I think... but I don't want to cause any trouble, so...): "Haha! Gotcha, right-wingers! Your extremist policies are literally worse than Hitler and all the world's ills are *your* fault, now until the end of time!"

There was a perfectly good candidate - one that was not only favored to win tonight, but also who still has incredible approval ratings - better than that of either of the two running today. We just wanted you to feel the Bern, but instead you're burning mad.

DNC - listen up: You fucked up. You fucked up really good. You ignored the people while trying to pay back favors by building a corrupt dynasty. You took the second most universally hated candidate, and served him a win on a silver platter by betting on the #1 most universally hated candidate.

I may not have agreed with his take on how to run our country but I would've trusted him.$This honestly upsets me so much. Bernie didn't deserve to be treated the way he did. Most promising candidate in generations and DNC denied his chance to make a difference.$You did this Clinton, Bernie would've beaten Trump.$No fucking thank you.$The DNC is to blame if Trump wins. $Blame the Democratic party.  This was the year of change, of a revolution.....and they put the absolute worst person on the ballot.$Oh for fucks sake give this shit up already $I hope the DNC feels like a bitch after all they did to screw Bernie...$He would have been absolutely destroyed by Trump. I voted Bernie and truly liked him. Realizing that he was a. Self described "Democratic Socialist," Trump would have never let that down. 

What we are seeing here is that he is a magnificent manipulator and a great communicator to stupid people. Never underestimate the power of stupid people. $Yes, it should have. We all knew it. I warned people after the primaries. Clinton supporters told me it was otherwise and that Clinton would have no trouble taking on Trump. I knew that was wrong, and now that's proved to be the case. This is a lesson that the Democratic establishment will not soon forget.$this is the biggest shitpost lmao$Enough, I am no Trump lover, but Trum would had beaten the fuck out of Sanders too. Stop counting the man out, just stop.$Hahaha, Bernie sucks. $[deleted]$I want to find him, hug him, cry, and tell him he's the hero we all need$No, it shouldn't have. Fuck you guys and fuck Reddit.

President Trump. Deal with it.$**FUCK** the DNC!$As a Trump voter, I agree. Didn't agree with him on everything, but he seemed to care and to have integrity.$DAE Socialism?$He would have lost.$$[deleted]$No shit, bernie would have won. $Hillary has nobody to blame but herself. Her hubris has irreparably damaged the Democratic party.$You know what? I was salty when Bernie lost to a degree. But now that for certain that Clinton is doomed thanks to the DNC's buffoonery and due to that Trump is going to be in the big house....it just makes me angry. It frustrates me. Bernie probably would've won. It makes me upset because of among the great names I respect so dearly in the presidential halls...the fact that I have to add Donald Trump to that list. I'm...I've got no words.$A middle finger specifically. $"Not us!  Blame the media!  Blame ~~their~~ third party voters!! Anyone but us!"

Edit: don't forget Russia. $And Hillary...$Republican have to take the blame for Trump winning their primaries by stoking their base with misinformation, and Democrats have to take the blame for letting Trump win the election by being corrupt and neglecting their base causing them to not show up. Both parties fucked up. This is wholesale rejection of the current state of politics. This is what happens when you don't listen to the voters. I'm not saying any of this is the smart thing to do, but desperate people do desperate things.$If he had won the primary he also would have won the election, no question.$Been saying this for months and months. All the DNC's fault and deep down there was a piece of me that wanted Trump to win so they might realize they fucked up.$Dude. It's not even if anymore. I'm truly frightened for the 4 years to come. $They elected the only candidate possible of being Trumped. $TYT agrees. DNC is a crapshoot.$Exactly, the Democrats only have themselves to blame because they wanted Hillary are their Rep. If they had Bernie Sanders, I would of voted for him, and yes I didn't vote for Hillary, so there is a loss vote for the Democrats right there. And I know there are many others who felt the same way.$I'll be shocked if Michigan goes R. It's close but Detroit is yet to report.  I have no idea about Wisconsin. $Some networks have already called Wisconson for Trump$Michigan is slowly creeping towards Clinton. Wisconsin, my state, unlikely to be for Hillary. If Trump becomes POTUS I really wouldn't mind a blue Senate.$They wanted Hillary at any costs. 

Elect Clinton or die tryin'$Their antics also cost them majority in the house as well. Think last I heard it was a 92% of republicans holding the house. Instead of a gridlocked Trump, we are looking at a Trump with power unless half the republican party does their best at obstructing him as well the next 4 years. $They fucked themselves over. Corrupt shits.$The DNC though is the Clintons; they have controlled the entire apparatus for the last 15 years - Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Donna Brazille, Tim Kaine - the last independent operator at the DNC was Howard Dean, and he was run out of town into low-grade punditry.$The big money that owns the DNC and the media would rather lose with Clinton than win with Bernie.$You and me both. This is absolutely ridiculous. With the House still in Republican control this is going to be a very VERY long 4 years$From the UK, this feels really similar to David Cameron shooting himself in the foot with Brexit$It really was sickening seeing how truly desperate she was to win, with Bernie it felt like he was in it for us and not himself$As a Johnson voter...Bernie would have beaten Trump.$Yeah but who the fuck thought that people would rather burn everything to the ground than have a mediocre president? In fucking disbelief as a hardcore bernie supporter.$For all the Hillary supporters who called me an idiot when I told them they were going to get Trump elected: Congratulations! You're not as smart as an idiot.$I think Sanders won in Wisconsin and I know he won in Michigan. Can't be too surprised Hillary is struggling there.$All the pollsters HRC's campaign hired you would think they would have figured that out. The DNC is a joke.$spicy$All that money paid to fill /r/politics is money down the drain. $And they'll blame everyone but themselves.$For all the Hillary supporters who called me an idiot every time I said they were going to get Trump elected. Who's the idiot?$Yeap, been saying this (and getting downvoted) for months now.  This is absolutely the DNC / Clinton's fault.  

If anything good comes from this, hopefully the DNC learns their fucking lesson and *RESPECTS* the voice of the people they claim to represent.

$The DNC really did blow it. They lied to their followers and enough people were pissed off to vote third party or not vote at all. Bernie would have crushed Trump and the DNC failed to realize that Clinton just couldn't do the same. I feel your pain...$The Podesta emails really showed us how fucked over Bernie really was in this election.  This election wouldn't even be close if Bernie was the Democratic candidate.$Yep and to be 100% blunt I put a lot of the blame on women democrats.  I know more than a few who were committed to Hillary from day 1 simply because she was a woman, and they overlooked the huge issues she has with corruption and lies in her past, not to mention the underhanded moves she made against Bernie during the primaries.  I would gladly vote for a woman who was actually genuine and had original thoughts that weren't molded by opinion polls.  Unfortunately Elizabeth Warren was the next best thing and in my eyes she sold her soul by supporting Hillary.$I look forward to all the hillary fans insisting "it wasn't rigged!" and "wikileaks is faked by russians!" to your comment.

Not even touching on the fact that Clinton literally never pulled decisively away from Trump while Sanders beat him in pretty much every poll.$https://i.redd.it/4n33sdv9uslx.png

Edit:  I found this just now with a google search because I remember somebody posted a few of these either in the last days of /r/sandersforpresident, or maybe in /r/political_revolution.  This one was my favorite.$It's interesting. There's not just a huge split in the DNC right now, but also in the GOP. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if a new party (or two) takes the stage after this election. $I'd love to say I told you so also, but if trump wins it looks like republicans are going to have the majority in the house, senate, AND the president. That's new levels of scary I didn't really even consider happening tonight.$But it was her turn, remember? $> This is what happens when you rig your primary.

This is what happens when you shit all over half the country for supporting the candidate you don't want them to$Same here, never donated before in my life and I loved Obama. I hope DWS sees an end of her political career and a future in "Would you like fries with that?"$The dems literally cheated themselves out of a win. $Haha remember when they kept hyping up Clinton on her 'electability'

Hahahahahahaha $This. So fucking much this. I am so fucking furious, because this baffled and angered me the most. I have staunchly conservative and libertarian friends that were excited about Bernie. They changed their registration to try and vote for him. They cheered him on. Once he lost, they were back on the table. Once the DNC's corruption came to light, they were lost forever.

I can't believe the DNC lost sight of that. I can't believe they were so arrogant, dismissive, and pissed on 46% of their voters as well as all independents. They called Bernie voters children. They said it was immaturity at work, even when protesters were at the convention doors. Fucking arrogant idiots. They never fucking learned their lesson. Never. It wasn't even just stupidity, it was bad politics. There were a thousand missteps in this election. Manipulating the primaries lost hardcore Berniecrats and the independents. Tim Kaine as VP alienated the far left. Clinton even alienated the LGBT vote at one point with her shitty Nancy Reagan admiration. The DNC couldn't stop being selfish and self-serving for 2 minutes. Even their attempts to influence the media fanned the flames as they brought *more* attention to Trump. They never even talked about policy over the past few months, just fear mongering (gee, how inspirational).

I'm sure all of that REALLY won over undecided voters!

I swallowed my pride and voted for Hillary. I sucked it up. I even said as I filled in the oval, "Bernie, don't let me down." That was painful. I've had reluctant voter experiences, but never a *painful* vote where I felt like I was losing a piece of my pride. What the fuck did they expect? Not everyone was going to suck it up and willingly work against their conscience "for the good of the country." I am unbelievably disgusted.

And now we have a racist, misogynistic, climate denier in control of nuclear weapons. This could very well fuck us up for generations. Not just us, but the world as the Paris accords for climate change will likely be out the window ASAP.

Fuck them all. I hope the DNC burns for what they did to us and this country.

Sorry for hijacking your comment. I'm really processing all of this, like I guess everyone is. If you're in another country and reading this, I am so sorry. I am really sorry. We tried. Our system failed us  and we still tried.$Damn, that bums me out, russ was one of the good guys.  What happened to this election?  Did Clinton really poison the well that much?$Just saying "they elected a Republican Governor" isn't really telling the whole story here in Vermont. Republicans and Democrats aren't really viewed the same way here as they are on the national level, especially on the Republican side where they are much more centrist leaning/actually Conservative. Phil Scott has served as the Lieutenant Governor for a few years now and is generally well known/well liked by most people regardless of political affiliation, not to mention has lived his entire life in the state. 

His opponent Sue Minter on the other hand was someone who most consider to be an "out of stater" despite having served in the VT House for a couple of terms herself, and was seen as bringing in a lot of special interest money to try and "buy the election". 

Also going against her was the unpopularity of the outgoing Democratic Governor, Peter Shumlin. Even his own constituents/previous voters (myself included) lost a lot of love for the guy after years and years of failed projects (most notably the state's run down joke of a Health Exchange) and unfufilled promises/outright lies (his big campaign item when he first ran was the pursuit of a single payer health care strategy for the state, which he ended up just bailing on entirely after not talking about it/not taking it seriously for years and years).

$I hate DLC too. #neverpreorder$It's the fault of every Democratic voter who voted in the primaries for an under-FBI-investigation corrupt uncharismatic candidate with uncountable skeletons in their closet.

And the media and DNC for promoting that terrible candidate, colluding against the opposition, and forcing an extremely pro-establishment candidate into the general in a year defined by populism.

Hopefully they take a long hard look at themselves and finally reform. The Dems, Obama aside, have been getting their asses kicked all down the ballot for 20 years now.$The DNC, Team Clinton and the White House spent *years* making sure that Clinton would be the nominee. $Walked all over Trump? What am I even reading$And they will all walk off into the sunset with their money bags wondering how everyone else messed things up. $Good theyve been co-conspirators for giving Americans a raw deal for decades now. Todays democrats couldn't shine the shoes of FDR's, JFK's and yes even Bernie's vision for the party.$The death of third way democrats, the rise of trump republicans. Good god...

Don't dynasties generally have multiple generations?

The Bushes for example could be called a dynasty, I'd think.$If Trump wins Florida, Michigan and Wisconsin, it's looking like it will be over. Dems thought this election would be a slam dunk. Boy were they wrong. 

Edit: They called it in FL. As a Floridian, I'm sorry America. $With Hillary vs Trump the narrative has consistently been 'the lesser of two evils'.

If Bernie was in there it would've literally been 'good vs evil'.

Bernie has more integrity than any politician I've seen in my lifetime...it's almost unbelievable that someone like him exists. 

We could've had Bernie and instead we got Trump. That's so profoundly sad to me.$ .Democrats were arrogant after they turfed  Bernie . People don't want the establishment anymore . Voters for trump by in large are just ordinary people fed up with the establishment and democrats entrenched them by belittling them at every turn . You became the establishment they fought against.  $Bernie would have won by a landslide. Hillary had WAAAAYYYYY too much baggage dragging her down. Any other Republican candidate would have blown her out of the water already.$They already collected their checks for their online manipulation "job"$Right here, eating my words.

I just wanted a candidate that would win. I was willing to forgive DNC for their corruption because I assumed they'd at least deliver that. I put too much faith in oligarchs to know what they're doing.$Bernie/Gabbard 2020$I thought the GOP hated Trump and tried their hardest to replace him up to the primaries?

Two years of this then a Berniecrat landslide in the midterms.$Agreed! https://www.reddit.com/r/RanktheVote/
In Maine, Ranked-Choice-Voting is potentially going to pass. It's just 1 state. Let's get the momentum going!$I said something similar.  At the time, I'd conceded that Hillary might even make a better president than Obama.  But, like you, it was obvious to me that she could never win a general election.  She would have lost against Dole, Dubya, McCain, or Romney... not a doubt in my mind. 

I thought Trump might be able to take her down, but the "grab them by the pussy" video, I thought, was the end of him.

Nope.  That's how much Republicans hate her.  They'll even take the sort-of-rapey guy over her.$Eh, you underestimate anti-Clinton votes.$bernie was consistently polled double digits above trump before the end of the primaries - this was waaaay before the pussy grabbing comments which the bern would have definitely taken advantage of. Bernie would have destroyed trump$Type "head to head: Trump vs. Sanders" into your browser search box. They have polled it across the nation (not just Reddit). Bernie would have killed Trump. In fact, I suspect that the Dems could have nominated a lawn chair to run against Trump and won. 

Hillary had a ton of baggage and she didn't inspire a lot of love among dems. Dems showed up to vote against Trump. Republicans showed up to vote for Trump. $[deleted]$The entirety of Reddit has legitimately turned into /r/conspiracy 

It's absolutely amazing. $I'd have liked an O'Malley v Kasich debate. They both seem like reasonable people who can articulate their points and have a meaningful, rational discussion.$Instead people were shitposting about how Ted was way worse than Trump. The Left made so many miss steps. $lol, hindsight. Anyone who has actually payed attention to Hillary the last 30 years knew she couldn't win against a wet towel. Some thought a orange toupee was shit enough to win against, but it wasn't. It was not even a minority opinion of Bernie supporters that this is what would happen. This is the same story I've been hearing since February at least. It was prophesied in fire in the sky but Hillary supporters couldn't see what was in front of their face.$Goddamn idiots. Theyve ruined things for my children. We could have made real strides! We could have left parts of the past behind!$Is there a chance he'd run in 2020?$Remember when he won the Michigan primary and it was very unexpected?$This hurts me again.$You really think the same people that stole the election from him would let him decide the budget.

A novelty candidate. $No one here seems to have wanted hillary; just to stop trump from winning, it seems.$Good morning, hope you aren't too fucked up from last night.

The shilling was bad. They pulled funding, you can immediately see because of this 20000+ upvoted post.$I didn't agree with everything he had to say certainly, but out of anybody it seemed like he genuinely wanted to improve the country. $Yep and I bet they don't give a damn. $DNC is to blame. They should not have ran Hilliary at all. You cant followup someone as exciting as Obama with someone as exciting as a wet rag. Hilliary is an experienced politician but shes a relic of a bygone era.$According to Reddit, democracy is only good when it swings their way. Examples: Trump & Brexit$Clinton walked into this fight with a shit ton of baggage. $Wrong. She was a turd with lipstick in the primaries and things have actually gotten worse.

Bernie wouldn't be entrenched in FBI investigations or foundation scandals or anything like that because he isn't a dirtbag criminal like she is. None of her baggage is new. She's been a crook for 20+ years and her thirst for power robbed us all of a good president. Now her hubris has given us Donald fucking Trump.

I loathed her yesterday. Today if she were put to death, I would applaud.$Fuck you too, bud$They are SO fuckin' salty right now.$Mostly at this idiot.

Sincerely,

Democrats 
$And Donna Brazile...$But it was her turn. /s$I mean honestly the DNC has known for decades that the public hates Hillary. They tried to force her down our throats anyway.

They could have picked any other party stooge (or Bernie) and they would have won in a landslide.$I just hope this opens the door for a legit third party candidate in 2020. Donors have to see the potential in finding a candidate that will laugh at both parties for the next four years.$And then the Dems tried the same FUD strategy!

"You can't let him win!" 
"The world will end!"

Nothing but FUD instead of actual message.$How did the Republicans fuck up again? They control congress and have the presidency? They'll stack the supreme court and control that for how many years? Then they control redistricting too. Democrats just ended themselves.$Definitely, but our man totally dropped the ball by not attempting to run as an independent after the primaries.


He would've been popular enough to take part in the debates and then really could've overtaken the other two.$A full cleaning is needed of the establishment.$4 years?

I'm terrified of the next 50 years.  Scalia was on the Supreme Court nearly 30 years.  Trump will probably get to severely skew the court with several appointments (Breyer is 78, Ginsburg is pushing 84 and of course Scalia's current vacancy) and those justices could well be there for 30 years and it could take decades to unwind the damage...if ever.
$I'm an immigrant who is currently terrified and my partner is disabled and might lose insurance and medical care if trump wins.$Wisconsin looks leaning toward Trump.  3% ahead so far

I've been a registered Republican for nearly 20 years and I changed my affiliation so I could vote for Bernie in the primary. The DNC fucked their own party by rigging the primary and even helping push Trump into the Republican nomination because he'd be an easy foe. This is what you get you stupid fucking twats.

I voted for Gary Johnson because fuck Trump and fuck Hilary - you smarmy bitches.$Except right now it looks like both houses of congress are going to go to the Republicans. $Billary or Bust$haha I think we're all going to die... *begins sobbing*$*If* Trump wins, which is still a big if because Hillary could conceivable pull thru as urban Democratic strongholds are counted last, then it'll be good for the party as it will mean they've hit rock bottom.  Then maybe they will give their young base that change they've been demanding. $A fucking Republican trifecta with Trump holding the reins. Oh, ya don't forget the now Republican Supreme Court. 

This is it... Hold me.$They will fall in line$They fucked us over, remember that$This so fucking much. All the major players were firmly in her camp. [Michael Moore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfgZqY5SajM) has been a god damn nostradomus this election. he called Trump before the primaries cause he understands the undercurrent of people pissed against a system that blatantly does not care about them.$Yep. The point is control by the establishment. Bernie is not on their team. A Bernie victory in the general is a loss for the DNC.$The thing that made me register democrat and try to get Bernie as the candidate was when I saw that he voted against the 2008 patriot act.

The guy believes in large government (which isn't necessarily something I agree with) but still was able to recognize that the patriot act was a trick and harmful to the people. That says so much to me about his interest in politics.$Ordinarily my political position is pretty disparate from someone like Bernie, however I believed he was someone who truly cared for the US. It was refreshing and had my attention like none of the other candidates. $Yup.$That's how desperate some people are, after the Great Recession, stagnant wage growth, shuttered factories due to Globalization and outsourcing, and a two party duopoly that's been captured by corporations and the 1%.$Wisconsinite here, Bernie won!  

DNC, you think you might have fucked yourselves by cheating the guy who won in my state?  $Seems like fucking him over and making fun of his supporters wasn't a good idea. Who knew? Also, fuck the DNC for helping Clinton win the nomination against Bernie. He would be destroying right now.$They don't care. They were willing to risk it, because Bernie doesn't play ball with the establishment.$Absolutely, tomorrow the topic will be all about those damn Bernie Bros who gave Trump the election.

I can't believe how angry I just got at typing that sentence.

Edit: and I guess I summoned one. This is so fucking disgusting, they are blaming us because they picked a terrible candidate and were despicable towards the other wing of their own party.$Exactly. All I hear is if you don't vote for Clinton and allow trump to win, you're to blame for a trump presidency. How bout not? How bout fuck yourself? Hillary supporters and the DNC did nothing but make every effort possible yo *exclude* bernie voters because "she doesn't even need you." Yeah? How's your smug pride of "it's her turn" look now? You all fucking deserve trump, but those that actually didn't put the blinders on and actually *tried* to make objective change happen in this country do not. Fuck you Hillary supporters. Fuck the DNC.$Happening right now in this post. $It's gonna be the Russians, Wikileaks, Green Voters, Libertarian Voters...everyone except those that rigged the primary and gave it to the lady that couldn't fill up a small gym instead of the guy doing 20k+ rallies on a fucking Tuesday here in CA.

People don't like being called retarded bigoted hillbillies, and they certainly don't vote your way. 

The only way Clinton would win is if she and the DNC focused on the issues and pulled the mud slinging (he slung enough mud at himself honestly). If you forced him to defend his positions instead of allowing him to scream that the establishment is against him. He's  winning *because* he was demonized, which made it easier for every right leaning voter to swing his way because they had an excuse to ignore their main news outlets.$Yes$I'm a registered republican who voted for Gary Johnson tonight.  I would have voted for Bernie.  I don't agree with everything he does but he genuinely wants to take care of Americans.  He was the only one that really remembered that the President SERVES THE PEOPLE not the other way around.  He is the only one that I believe would have vetoed a bill he personally agreed with if he though the majority of American's didn't want it.  He is the only candidate that I truly believe would have done what was right for all Americans, not just the members of his political party.

$Wisconsin and Michigan are the only important ones left.$Yeah, that's what makes me so sad (and angry).

Been watching the Five-thirty-eight livestream.[ This](http://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/2016-election-results-coverage/?lpup=18617219#livepress-update-18617219) makes me hopeful (that his movement may live on).

> One thing I’ve been thinking about here is where the Democratic Party goes next. Three of the last four Congressional elections (2010, 2014 and 2016) were bad for the Democrats, leading to a thin bench. President Obama served out his two terms. The Clinton dynasty is over. But the most obvious alternatives to Clinton — Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden — are also pretty old. It seems that all of the energy in the party is on the left, and it wouldn’t be surprising if the 2020 nominee were someone from the Sanders wing of the party. But who is that candidate? I don’t know. There are a lot of opportunities for talented, up-and-coming, left-wing politicians, beginning with the 2018 midterms.  -Nate Silver$> People don't want the establishment anymore .

This.  $All that baggage and it's still this close. Bernie's squeaky clean record would have slid him straight into the Oval Office. Even the specter of the word "socialism" wouldn't have stopped him.$The record has been correc- oops, wait, she lost and is an idiot along with the entire system that put her in place to do so.

Way to go DNC and media! You'll handwave and try to blame someone else, but we're tired of your bullshit rhetoric, obviously. You can't do that shit and talk shit to us and expect us to then bow down and back you. See all this? This is your fault - fuck off.

This is the result of astroturfing and subreddits being flooded with fake narratives and bullshit. It all comes crumbling down because it's fucking lies.$Funny thing is, and you can probably still look up the news stories, Bernie fared better head to head vs. Trump than Hillary, in every poll ever done on the subject.

True, that was months in advance of the election, but still.

I just feel "Bernie's skeletons" -- there are probably a few mild ones --- are nothing compared to Clintons'.

Black voters deeply disliked Bernie Sanders, for ... well I don't know why. He marched during the Civil Rights movement, I don't know what else a guy has to do. Yes, he's a white man, get over it.$As much as I'd love that. Bernie will be 79 years old. That's a bit much. I'll just be happy with Gabbard as President.$The GOP hates Trump. Many Americans outside of the coasts liked Trumps fuck the establishment mentality. Plus a wet fart could have probably beat Hillary in this election. DNC shouldn't have intentionally screwed over Bernie.$The GOP is not its voters and would be rather insulted for you to conflate the two.$During the primaries I tried to explain to Hillary supporters that if she was nominated, that Republicans wouldn't just crawl over broken glass to vote against her, you could set that broken glass on fire and they would still do it, with a smile on their face.  

I knew Republicans and Independents that were so excited to vote for Bernie.  Not one of them would have even considered Clinton.  This was in N.C., btw. 

$Well this guy grabs people by the pussy, but this gal rigs debates, and deletes evidence. Well I wouldn't trust this guy with my daughter, but my daughter ain't the white house.$YEah I don't know what that dudes talking about. Salty Clintonite no doubt.  They're lost now.$Dems lost a *ton* of votes to disenfranchised Bernie supporters. They would have gotten the votes they have now plus the Bernie voters. It would have been a layup for Dems with him as their nominee. $I'm sure Bernie would have destroyed trump on the Reddit election, but what this election is showing us is that quite frankly, the country is turning red. I just don't think Boomers and X'ers took or ever would have taken Bernie seriously. 

$Well the polls also showed a landslide victory for Clinton.

Apparently polls aren't all that reliable.$Haven't we learned today that polls mean shit??$Bear in mind that polls said Clinton would destroy Trump too.$Keep in mind a couple of things.

1. All those polls were conducted with exactly no attacks carried out on Sanders by Trump or the GOP. Meanwhile their polling against Clinton included months and decades of attacks against her.

2. Clinton was easily beating Trump in the polls.

Saying that Sanders would have wiped the floor with Trump is a huge shot in the dark because nobody actually had the opportunity to do real polling as both sides tore into each other (and as we have learned polling means jack shit anyway).$And the thing they didn't push about O'Malley was that he had actual real tangible results for doing a hell of a job in not only Maryland but Baltimore. I lived in Baltimore when he ran for Governor and won. As Mayor of Baltimore he did a lot to clean up the town crime wise and push Baltimore from a town of poor people living in one of the highest crime areas of the nation into a town that was gentrifying some of its high crime but prime real estate neighborhoods, reviving art, and encouraging the poor who lived in the city to contribute in fixing it. 

As the Governor of the state he managed to turn Maryland into a financial power house, taking advantage of the big government presidency of Obama and attracting wealthy DC elite into living in MD. 

Simultaneously I think O'Malley could have been a great candidate. It used to be that people didn't trust senators because all they do is argue and vote for legislation. They never have to lead or make hard decisions on state budgets or appoint people to positions of leadership much the same way a president appoints a cabinet.

There's too much pandering in Senate and Congress politics. You have to return favors with favors. I mean, after a long tenuous primary where Obama was clearly the favorite HRC flat out refused to concede even though she lost on all counts and wanted to wait for the super delegate vote, etc. to come in so she could rig it. What ends up happening? He ends up appointing one of his biggest rivals to an important Chief of Staff position to pay back the fact that she conceded instead of drew out a contentious primary where they had to count every vote. 

People would have known who O'Malley was and he could have been seen as an alternate choice to Bernie and how virally popular Bernie was had HRC not run or received the backing of all those corporations and the other elite she had to back her up. Politics, business as usual, is a bunch of people who really work for the wealthy standing up and giving buzz word answers to non-issues. HRC epitomized that. Why do you think even the conservative media was pushing for Cruz or Rubio over Trump? They wanted someone they could buy and sell in as President and they already owned Hillary.

I'd have liked to see O'Malley versus Bernie for the primary if for no other reason than O'Malley made a good leader in both Baltimore and Maryland and he isn't as radically socialist as Bernie. While I would have voted for Bernie I just don't think a lot of Bernie's ideas are realistic. We have to help people out of their poverty, this is true, but the other side of the coin is, we shouldn't be allowing people who are just drains on society from government assistance to continue to be drains. If you want a 15 dollar minimum wage then you have to say to people who are capable of working these 15 dollar minimum wage jobs "Sorry, you can't stay on government assistance anymore." And Bernie was never willing to overcome the fact that he was a politician to real talk outside of his party lines. Sure, we need to have universal healthcare for everyone. But, those countries that have universal healthcare also have some of the strictest immigration laws around and don't just shrug their shoulders and say "Oh, you're illegal and you don't pay taxes? Well, here's government insurance anyways!" No, in fact, in liberal utopias like Germany and Denmark if you are caught as an illegal immigrant in those countries by seeking out medical help, they will help get you better then deport you right back to the country you came from. $Bernie vs Kasich would have been fantastic in my book.  Bernie vs Trump has a nice symmetry to it in that they represent productive and unproductive solutions to anti-establishment, but with a Bern vs Kasich race I would have been fine with either winning.$probably not, too old :($He'll be 79$He hasn't ruled it out but he'll be pushing 80. But who's to say another Berniecrat won't take up the banner in his place$I 'member$An openly misogynistic, racist with **ZERO** political experience. Yeah, Hillary screwed the pooch big time.$[deleted]$Well the problem isn't just that they ran her, they were supposed to be impartial.  This was not the case.$Sanders saying he liked what happens in Venezuela? Those rape comments? Being a socialist in a country where lots of people equate that with communist?

I like Bernie, but let's not pretend that Fox and Breitbart would drag him through the mud as much as Clinton was.$Who beyond all comprehension, was re-elected. Blows my mind.$Absolutely. Amidst my disappointment about Trump's likely victory, there's a strange sense of satisfaction coming from the fact that their vile, vile tactics worked against them. 

Fuck you, Debbie. $She was a puppet. The Clintons have been maneuvering for a decade for this election. It's on them, not DWS. $She fucked the whole world by undermining democracy.$The only upside of a Clinton loss is that this DWS piece of garbage won't get her appointed position that Hillary likely promised her. $I'd say her face is punishment enough but no. Fuck her. Fuck this whole election year. Stressing our country to these levels for no reason.$She was just another puppet. $/r/punchablefaces$Hey that cunt and her vile evil crooked actions during the primaries made me jump on the Trump Train. No regrets. Fuck you Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Big FUCK YOU CUNT!$And you're happy that Trump could win?$Sincerely, 

No Longer Democrats$[deleted]$Yup, if the Republicans had put anyone else up I'd probably have voted for them just to avoid another Clinton presidency. If Sanders had been up on the Dem side, I probably would have voted for him over anyone else.

I say this as someone who has never voted for a Democrat, and generally has a policy of voting against all Democrats.$Literally any other democratic candidate would have won. $It won't. I thought *this* would be the year of the 3rd party candidate. With a full Republican government I see them getting a lot done (for better or for worse) and many Republicans will be enthralled and happily reelect them all in 4 years. $The party system is too entrenched.  Look how effective it was for the DNC to say that Bernie was not actually one of them.$No. As much as I love the guy, he would have been a Nader to Hillary and Trump would have won hands-down.$I highly doubt that would happen. Most likely he would just eat massively into Hillary's voter base.$No, just no. Independents do not stand a chance against the two main parties. They just don't.

I wish, but the chances of an independent winning are close to nil as long as we keep first past the post voting.$No, he wouldn't have.  $This is the big thing. Now that they have the Presidency and Congress, they're gonna rush through Scalia's replacement. And there's plenty of old(er) conservative judges that can now retire and get replaced.

That said, hopefully the judges aren't completely retarded. If you think about what's changed; Gay rights, abortion, healthcare, etc., most of that was done with a conservative court.$[deleted]$It just got called. $Thank you. I am so goddamn angry at the DNC. The party deserves to burn for this one, as far as I'm concerned. 

As a lifelong Bernie supporter, I can tell you I feel the sting like you talk about. The DNC fucked us all over, real good. I'm no hippie, but science is science - i really, honestly don't think the planet can withstand the climate-denying policies (and non-policies) a Trump administration brings. At least with Hillary she could be convinced to act, if not boldly lead. With this guy .... fuck.


This outcome is sad and depressing on sobering and profound levels. It means we are our last option, so my suggestion to you is to get involved. /r/Political_Revolution has good resources, but so does your city hall. Join a committee, bring and make some friends - real things can get done.


Good luck.$46d/48r for the Senate right now. House will go Republican, and strongly so.

Edit:

Senate: 47d/48r - guaranteed technical 50/50 split. Remember everyone, neither party constantly votes 100% their party. A close split is fine. We will hear a lot about the Senate in the next couple years I think.

Edit2:

Republicans just hit the 218 needed for majority in the House.$Yeah$Trump is now 1 Wisconsin away from winning the presidency, and he currently leads in that state.$It's impossible now buddy, if he wins in Romney states where he's leading by yuge margins he's over 270$Yeah this could be very bad. I don't want a party controlled government. $Bend the knee!$His description of Trump being used as a human Molotov cocktail against the establishment sounds pretty spot on.

Well. Fuck. Good luck, everyone.$Seriously. Give me some actual fucking change. Let's shake this shit hole up. I'm a libertarian leaning person, but would have voted for Bernie just to see what one extreme would do with healthcare. Enough of this quasi bullshit. Give me a true free market or give me universal healthcare. Stop giving me this spineless bullshit system.$Yea he recognizes that "big government" and "Effective government" are two minutely but critically different concepts.$For the longest time, I thought that all politicians were money grabbing whores. I am Chicago born and raised. It's in our blood to not trust slimy politicians that only want more power. For the first time in a decade, I voted in a primary and you'd better believe it was for Bernie.$He seems like the most honest candidate, with the least shady past. Like you, I don't agree with some of his points, but at least he's a real guy and not entirely full of shit $[Here's Bernie getting arrested protesting for civil rights in '63](http://www.trbimg.com/img-56c7bb9b/turbine/ct-willis-wagons-school-segregation-chicago-1963-photos-20160218/650/650x366)

The bird that visited Bernie on the campaign is leading the country to the future!$I doubt it, I think after tomorrow people will just start bitching about Trump and wait for the next election.$Set your country back to the fucking middle ages.$That is the real nightmare.  He could very well cause the overturning Roe v Wade.  Something I'm continually amazed is still a battleground.$They really couldn't help themselves.   Always looking for a way to twist the knife. $Yeah. This I'll never forget. I do not respect her anymore because of that. $Exactly.  Her smug attitude towards voters, her taking states for granted that she thought she had locked, and her OBVIOUSLY lying about her email server is what did her in.

$> I can see how some libertarians/conservatives might be excited about Bernie, despite their differences.

I had never seen more confusion among a group, than what I saw among gun owners (who on average vote republican, and make up a massive portion of their base) than this election.

While few thought Bernie was a friend to their cause, hardly anyone **wanted** to vote for fucking Trump. Hell he was a staunch Democrat prior to this.

But instead the Dems put up Hillary, who is the absolute anathema to anyone who thinks the second amendment deserves the paper it's written on. 

Leaving the swing voters to go to Gary Johnson, and any possible gains into previously Republican territory totally lost by the Dems.

Way. To. Fucking. Go. -.-$DNC fucked everything up. Trump will most likely win and its the DNCs fault. $exactly. You hit the nail on the head. So many of us would have voted for Bernie, but didn't because we felt betrayed and disliked Hillary$if pcmasterrace has taught us enough, its that we never preorder, never fall for hype.$And my axe!$But it was HER turn! Take it or leave it! /s$I think that this time around it's less of the left-right spectrum rather than just putting up a good, honest candidate. 

In the year of the anti-establishment sentiment, Hillary is not likely to do well at all. $Not a Trump fan at all, but his anti establishment stance was tempting. I really wish I could have voted for Bernie again. $because uneducated masses are what big business want and all the uneducated masses are trending more and more conservative $That's what really scares me. There's a very real chance that Trump will do something to get impeached, or otherwise be deemed unfit to serve, at which point Pence takes over. Just look at his history as the governor of Indiana to see why that would be scary.$this is 100% worse than trump presidency $The day Chelsea runs for Senate and wins without having any prior experience is the day I hang myself from a bridge.$Donald won Florida already lol $thanks for the first laugh I've had in hours.$I like that we"re finally important in Michigan. $Hillary is a white woman. Her husband jailed more Black people than any prez in history. She called at-risk Black youth "superpredators." I can't for the life of me understand why some Blacks supported her so strongly, but whatever.$Because they didn't know him. The media didn't give him any attention except to run him as the hopeless underdog after primaries were well under way. Hell, I didn't even know about his [Erica Garner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Syln8IkOIqc) endorsement video until ~mid-June. 4 months after it aired. I don't think I'd ever seen it on TV once.$I'm really convinced that the Clinton campaign and DNC really pushed that narrative. The media hooked on to the idea that "black people hate Bernie" and it spun out of control and was plastered on every media outlet, even though it made no sense. I do feel like some black Americans supported Clinton because she was advertised as the "safe bet" while there was some lingering (counterintuitive and false) goodwill from Bill, but there were plenty of black protesters that despised her candidacy.$I'm with you on that. I love Bernie but 79 that's a little too old. Gabbard 2020!!$Shit, they'd set it on fire themselves just to enjoy letting Clinton supporters know how much pain they'll put themselves through to make sure she never reaches office.$To be fair, the DNC shit *all over* Sanders supporters. Wikileaks provided the 47% video equivalent for Clinton.$Bernie also would've gotten the Republican voters who think Trump is ridiculous. $im speaking about polls. not reddit. the poll questioned who people would favor (this was after trump clinched the nomination but while clinton and sanders were still running against each other)  

clinton had a about a 4-6 point advantage against trump  
bernie had 9-12 points against trump  
but strangely enough clinton vs bernie - clinton somehow had some edge of like 3 points. so yeaaaah basically the dnc shot themselves in the foot.  

Edit: reminder about the polls, although yes - wrong about Clinton v Trump they were correct about Clinton v Sanders and considering we don't have a magic crystal ball available they're pretty much the only thing we have to analyze how the election may have turned out $Bernie training montage?$Tulsi Gabbard?$He had no organization, he was at war with the party, he was outspent big-time, ugh.$People liked Bernie, and his favorable trended up as people learned about him.

Combine everything against Bernie that you can and compare it to one of the hundreds of disqualifying things Trump has done

Bernie would've won in a landslide.$Dirty and corrupt is often successful.$The next day was working for HRC$With election fraud, anything is possible.$>Fuck you, Debbie.

Sadly, the American people will never settle all their lawsuits.$> Trump's likely victory

I'm not gonna lie, this phrase freaks me the fuck out.  I need to drink more or wake up from this nightmare.$The only silver lining here is a satisfaction that they reap what they sow. $now this looks like a job for me...$It's on all of them. They all share equal blame/responsibility.$No puppetry involved, the people at the top of the DNC willfully and purposefully rigged the primaries against Bernie.  This is the sort of arrogant myopia that led them to believe they could run things from the top, shove major changes down people's throats without their input, and still get endlessly elected because of incumbent advantage and gerrymandering.   Pride always cometh before the fall.  $Why not both?$It's, uh, on all of them. Kaine, Schultz, Clinton, Belize...all been planning this, working towards this, since Obama got the nomination in 2007. No other option considered, no contingency plan made. The same hubris and short-sightedness that lost the Democrats the Senate will cost them this election.$Puppet or not, it can be on multiple people. It doesn't have to be solely one party's fault. They all fucked up. Hard. $It's a big fuck you to the Clintons. $thanks hillary for putting your ego above the good of the country$A beautiful, if not thin, silver lining. $Well, you sound like a true Trump voter.$im unhappy that either of them won. but i am happy that hillary didn't get her "destined" inaugeration$I voted for Hillary but I've pretty much accepted that we, as a country, deserve Trump as a president.  DNC completely fucked us all over.  Republicans fucked themselves over.  The result of that is President Trump (probably).

If anything, Trump has showed us all that even the most unlikely candidate can become president with enough grassroots support.  And a positive takeaway is that people can no longer sit on their asses and use the excuse 'my vote doesn't matter. it will change nothing.'  Because shit sure is hell is about to change.

This sucks, but I think America needs a few years to reflect on how bad we've been fucking up.  Hopefully we'll bounce back strong. $Absolutely, because it means that the democratic party MUST be beholden to its base.  You have to EARN my vote.  You can't just spit in my eye over and over and expect me to fall in line.  Nope.  

And this is better for progressives anyway.  Instead of getting a disastrous neo-liberal Goldwater girl that will just institute right-wing ideologies over the next 4-8 years (and then lose to a republican so we are stuck with ANOTHER right wing president for 4-8 MORE years), we get the chance to get an actual democrat in 4 years.  I'll take it.  Trump is a disaster, but not really any worse than HRC.  I want an actual democrat with actual progressive values.  The corrupt DNC and HRC deserve to lose.  What a pathetic campaign.  $You know what I believe the next 4 years will be, especially if it is all Republican?

Dismantling of our Republic.

Enjoy...$Sincerely,

Voting for Johnson for some reason$Proudly registered Independent now :)$You mean EXACTLY how it is happening right now?$Scalia was conservative leaning but a strict constitutionalist and none of those things actually violated the constitution. There's no guarantee that the replacement will hold the same views and a "conservative" court now might actually be traditionalist leaning instead.$I keep seeing conflicting reports of what Fox is saying. It seems like they're giving him an artificial edge or the reddit live thread is very behind/wrong. 

Edit: Sorry, I didn't meant to imply anyone was being biased. When I said, "It seems" I meant just that. It seemed, from what I saw from watching Fox and the Reddit Live Thread, that Donald was getting wins/votes applied to him well before the Reddit thread mentioned anything. Oddly enough, towards the end it appeared that the live thread was attributing wins to Donald 30-40 min before Fox reported on it. $Username checks out.$You are now banned from /r/United_States$Think about what this means for the fighting climate change. The environment will be one big casualty to this. If we weren't already past the point of no return, we certainly will be now.

Prescient.$He won a lot of hard democratic states.$I remember going to the polls and telling them my name and they said "oh, says here you're vote by mail. You didn't get it? You have to do a provisional vote." I'm sitting there wondering wtf is going on, because I never vote by mail and never had to do this. "... does my vote still count?" "Yeah, they just have to verify your eligibility later."

So I nervously fill it out and submit it and later on I read about other Californians and Bernie supporters facing the same bullshit. How did suddenly so many Bernie supporters get signed up for that? Very odd. And then I hear stories about them finding dumped provisional ballots in California.

That's when I lost all faith in the DNC and when I decided to vote third party. I don't give a shit if they don't win, maybe I can help them get that 5%. California was guaranteed not to go with Trump anyway, but regardless I'd have hated myself if I just bit my tongue and marked Hillary.

I'm proud to have voted third party even if they're just a sidenote this election. They fucked themselves over. Bernie polled so much better against Trump. If they really wanted to fight Trump, Hillary should've stepped on the sidelines.$Fuck yeah he did. I volunteered to register voters and literally all of them had to vote using provisionals. Shit was rigged as fuck $All the populism and working class support of Donald Trump without the sexism, xenophobia and policy disaster. Moderates already hate Trump enough to not vote for him, Progressives love Bernie. 3rd party shoved out of the race because Bernie's already pretty much 3rd party.

SCOTUS almost never revisits old rulings.$Yeah at least Bernie understood common gun owners being from Vermont, a relatively gun friendly state without being "crazy" about it. Like when Hillary openly said gun manufacturers should be held at fault for mass shootings, might as well say Ford and GM are at fault when a drunk driver is driving one of their rides and kills or seriously hurts an innocent person.$"AT ANY COST" - Brazile

Everytime I was polled in the last 2 weeks I said they could have my vote if they canned Brazile.$I'm not particularly invested in either candidate, but this is so obvious to me.

I have a feeling tomorrow all I will hear is how evil etc Republicans are. It will just be the same fucking idiotic narrative that got these two bozos the nomination in the first place.

$> Mike Pence

HOLY SHIT. I just looked him up... He's appalling. Way worse than even Trump or Hilary. What human garbage this man is. What utter human trash. And he's the vice president of the USA now.

Wow.

EDIT: It gets worse... He doesnt believe smoking kills? What? So anti-science all over the board, pro prison rape... what the fuck did you people vote for?! If you voted for this man you are a piece of shit, or an idiot.$The day Trump runs and wi -- wait...$http://i.imgur.com/g2r2oHU.gifv$I have no idea either. I got a lot of shit during primary season for asking these strong blocks why they were all-in for Hillary.

My only thought at this point is, the mere sight of a white man is just a bad taste in their mouth, even Bernie Sanders. A byproduct of the hyper-zelous, white-cis-man-hating SJW movement. Ironically, this bullshit has ushered in the exact opposite of their movement, President Donald J. Trump.$As the son of black immigrants, it's because of: "jobs and surplus." So, naturally, "Billary" seemed like a good idea. Not to mention they knew absolutely nothing about Sanders, and attempts to educate them on his stances and struggles were met by regurgitated mass media bile. With that said: *much* (not all) of the older black folk are the major culprits—pretty much anyone above the age of 30. Younger black voters—particularly those in my age bracket of 18-29 seemed to support Sanders. I'm going to chalk that up to younger folk digesting less partial online media whereas the older people rely on the massive yarn spun on their televisions.$The media was instructed to never mention his name, ever, to rig the election for Clinton.

Christ. If you're going to rig an election primary, at least rig it for someone with SOME charisma, like Elizabeth Warren or a wet fart. Right? Shit.$They very well could have, yeah. I remember BLM interuppted Bernie's rallies, no one else. When he was probably the most black sympathetic candidate of anyone.

Is that when the president is drilled into the dirt?$This is a sentiment I can agree with. You know that after Obama beat her in the primaries in 08 they sat down and decided that Obama would get his 8 years, then it would be Hilary's. And she's so pissed that people didn't just give it to her. $Well congrats, we're apparently about to give Donald Trump the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of our government. Nothing and no one will stop him, all of us will be long dead before the country recovers from this.

I guess this is better than 4-8 years of Hillary being blocked from accomplishing anything by congress.
$The correct move for the DNC here is to embrace the progressive wing that Bernie awakened.

$Regardless of what YOU think will happen. The blame is on the DNC. Don't blame the voters. Hillary and the DNC conspired every step of the way. They conspires to crush Bernie. They did. Bernie would have won. They conspired to lift Trump up as a GOP nomination because they thought that he'd be easy to beat. They did. Rubio or Rand Paul would have been much "better" than Trump. They conspired to have the media give as much negative press to Trump. They did. But all he needed was that attention to point back at the shitty person Hillary is. Hillary lost because she was the worst candidate the DNC has ever put forth. 

Besides Hillary Clinton is the most hawkish. She voted for/supported the wars and regime changes that caused your friend's death (sorry). Her and Trump have essentially the same history with gay marriage. And your friend... The health insurance that is saving his/her life is great. But it's not life saving.  People in the United States aren't denied life saving treatments with or without insurance. Get over yourself.

I'm fine with that so long as they're "letter of the law" conservatives like Scalia, who was a strong defender of 1^st and 4^th Amendment rights and not "reinterpret the Constitution to create a pathway to social conservativism" conservatives.

As a lifelong Democrat, I concur. The corrupt, money grubbing, corporate wing of the party took over and *installed* Hillary Clinton as the nominee. The large discrepancies between certain primary exit polls and the vote tallies should've been investigated. But Bernie's camp didn't press it. I wish they would have sued and exposed that scumbag DNC chair*person*.$What control(s) do the ppl have to correct Bernie being defrauded?$I have been a long time Libertarian, since I became fed up with the Republicans diving head first into Iraq for no reason, and the whole "Freedom fries" level of politics. I would have been OK with a Bernie Presidency. I would loathe either Hillary or Donald.

Reddit though, they have no idea. Bring up a white, middle to lower class voter from a fly over state. "Fuck you you racist trash, I hope you die in a gutter." That's the attitude I have seen on this website. People have watched their livelihoods melt away, and the Democrats offered virtually nothing.

So of course people reached out to a loudmouthed biggot who said, "Hey, over here. I'm with you guys."$Fuck yeah! This perfectly encapsulates how I feel.$Scalia defended torture because he said it works on the television show 24. Also, Donald Trump is insane, I wouldn't be surprised if he nominated his son to the supreme court.$I'll second that. Just to be clear, Conservatism, as a philosophy, can be summed up as "hey, tap the breaks" and "I'm going to need a lot more evidence to change anything". 
It's a perfectly appropriate, and often beneficial, position to have represented in government. 
Of course, the problem is that republicans are not particularly conservative. They tend to be very activist on social issues and they tend to increase government spending while in office so they aren't particularly fiscally conservative either. And, that is what makes me nervous. $Man, fuck her and the DNC. We had a chance to bring some real hope to the country but thanks to her shilling, ego, and horrible list of scandals we might just lose every bit of what little beneficial progress we've made so far. America's fucked. $Ultimately it was up to Bernie to make a stand after the truth came out.   If he ran third party then he'd now be blamed for Trump.   He had no winning path.   $THIS. Thank God.

They're saying they need to take a long hard look at themselves and at the Democrat ability to bring themselves down from the ivory tower.#

Im not trolling I am looking for an actual response, anyone out there understand this enough to give me a break down? 

$I really can't imagine what these people are going through.

Imagine working your whole life to buy a home to raise a family.

Now, the water is tainted and the property value must be essentially zero. Nobody is buying houses in Flint. These people have no way out and every day the value of houses they have to keep paying for is going down and down. $300 union plumbers were in Flint this weekend installing waters filters that were purchased and donated. Many families wouldn't be able to afford the filters on their own. 

Get your shit together, government.$I can't believe it's actually been almost 3 years! $If a city in a first world country can't even provide clean water for its citizens after 3 years, they are no longer worthy to be a city in a first world country. Everything in the town should be dissolved, and the city/state should be providing the residents with fair compensation for their moving expenses.

Put a nail in the coffin, and ensure that those who are responsible for this happening and not being fixed are held accountable for those actions. Money can't fix everything, and they have spent entirely to much trying to solve this problem without success.$Idk, maybe, just maybe people should start focusing on their local governments and elected officials instead of the president.$1 upvote = 1 water $Instead of "don't forget" posts to remind people, why not include why there is no water.

Obviously the city is still inhabited and functioning, but for some reason someone just hasn't green lighted the "fix it" operation.

Should we attempt a coup? Should we riot? Capitalism is a great thing, a wonderful thing. It promotes competition and innovation and jobs. The downside is that eventually it creates a huge gap between the super wealthy and the rest of us. That 1% controls everything and there is little to nothing we can do. I loved seeing the women of the world unite against Trump and his beliefs and utter disrespect of women- but what will come from it? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Some will argue with this and call me a pessimist, but its true, in the end we lose. We needed someone like Bernie in office who pointed out the gap of wealth and fairness in this country, but, sadly we must not have been ready for it. Hopefully after Trump gets through with his rampage, we will be, and another Bernie will be there to do some good for the little guys... because soon the many will not fear the few, and when that happens you will see a revolution like the ones you read about in History books. It is sickening that Flint does not have clean water... is it a money problem? NO. 40% of what I earn every single day goes to the Government- and a % of what you make does too- money isn't the problem, its greed. And contradictory to what my friend Gordon Gekko once said, greed is not good, especially when those we elected to represent us are the greedy ones. It is unacceptable and inexcusable- and lately, as a father of 2 young children, i've been very sad, actually the better adjective is scared, with where America is and where it is heading.  $Are you gallowboob?$This is what happens when a government uses its tax dollars for social welfare programs and attempts to rely on 100+ year old water/sewer/power infrastructure.

Just because Redditors stop upvoting articles about certain situations, doesn't mean news isn't still coming out about it. I'd point fingers at attention spans of Redditors more than anything. Another issue is that many Redditors use Reddit as their sole source of news, so they are going to miss many things that are happening if those things don't hit the front page.$That's the danger of the news cycle.$Russia is still occupying Ukraine.

They never found the planes.

There is still no news on the trillions of tons of missing crude oil from the Deepwater Horizon disaster. (Presumed to be hovering at the bottom of the ocean like a black river of fish death)

There are many more of these stories that get brushed under the rug, but I can't remember any, atm. (Kind of the problem with these types of things)$OK, Donny boy.  You're in charge now.  So whatcha gonna do to fix it?$But can you drink the water in Mexico now?$I'll hand it to Trump, that's a good line. Notwithstanding the existence or non-existence of any intentional substance behind it.$Insert laugh track$That's one hell of a quote right there. $[deleted]$You are suggesting, we should move car manufacturing back to Flint. I will see myself out!!

PS: edit$Everyone did.$City officials wanted to get off the Flint River supply when they found out that its levels of chlorine were high enough to be corrosive and harmful. The Emergency Manager vetoed them, which lead to the corrosive chlorine stripping mineral buildup from the lead pipes. Exposed metal then leeched into the water, spurred on by the still-corrosive water.

Those officials who knew but kept it quiet are being prosecuted. The Governor was being investigated, last I heard, but Republicans shut it down. State officials are blaming the Federal Government for not being more involved in their business.

It's politics as usual.$Friend of mine is a doctor at a hospital in PA, they get a ton of lead poisoning cases because their water is, I guess, even worse than Flint's. It's amazing that there are multiple places with such terrible water in the United States.$No, the media just stopped covering because it's got bigger and catchier things to complain about (i.e. Trump). The city officials don't have millions extra laying around to replace all of the pipes.


Meanwhile there are and have been 3,000 places in the US with considerably worse lead levels than Flint that have gotten 0 coverage. Flint just got publicized better because it's easier to scream at a shitty governor than pitch in and fix it.

I'm genuinely curious about the circumstances of you living there.$Also if it would it be cheaper just to pay everyone to move, why not? That seems better. I don't think Flint is booming even when hydrated. 

Edit: Hit send too soon.$There's options to fix things. There's expanding composite pipe for this type of job that goes in existing pipe and seals it back up. This would be very much cheaper than digging everything up and replacing it. This still isn't cheap and the problem is probably too big to fix. 

The only thing that could reasonably done is a government substadized overhaul, which honestly isn't likely viable as how more difficult it is to fix utilities after shit is above it. 

The government could buy out houses and such, but that opens up quite the can of worms. 

Or do nothing. That's cheap and flint is a small sized town with not that many voters and support....$> it would cost so much that it would be cheaper to get up and move the entire town

As a civil engineer who has worked on several water main replacement projects I refuse to believe this without some extensive study to prove so. Otherwise I see it as political jargain to sit on their hands.

I've heard the arguments that you would have to rip out the entire roads where the pipe is under the road. That is not true. We cut trenches in pavement all the time and patch the trench. You can even lay the new water main next to the old one. 

Think about the cost of rebuilding an entire city. You have to rebuild entire roads. Not just the pavement but you will have to do a ton of grading (moving dirt) to get them to standards plus a lot of sub base work. You will have to rebuild all the gas lines, electrical lines, water mains, communication lines, sanitary sewers, storm sewers, and rebuild all the buildings and house.

Compared to cutting pavement and patching it, laying new water mains, and replumbing peoples houses. Now the question is is Flint worth saving? Or do we just send everyone out to cities that need labor (oh wait where is that in the US)$Install whole house water filter in each house.

Edit: So http://michiganradio.org/post/experts-caution-flint-residents-whole-house-water-filters-have-downside apparently houses have lead pipes which is part of the problem

But filtering lead out of a water supply to your house can be solved for under $2k per house.$They do currently truck in a lot of bottled water, you can do a quick google search to see lots of "action" pics.

Honestly, speaking as someone who has had very close dealings with Flint Water Department, and their infrastructure, there isn't a good answer.

It would take BILLIONS to fix the current situation. Napkin math of super situation-vague water mainframe replacement costs (~$1m per mile) over the 1300+ miles of water pipe in Flint (not including copper service lines going to buildings) would be to the tune of $1.3 Billion or more. That's not including any water infrastructure customer side, or re-housing costs for apartment buildings.

There isn't a really good way to go about this. Either we bail out all 100k people in Flint, and relocate them elsewhere; spend the money to replace ALL of the pipe in Flint, which will take months /  years; do a sort of hybrid plan, moving people in harder to fix areas, and fixing other areas; or do as we are now, occasionally bringing the issue up, while the people of Flint still need to drink bottled water. The entire situation just sucks.

If you doubt me, I've been commenting on this issue for months, both here and on Imgur, and I currently work in the Water business. I can't divulge much more info, otherwise I could break client confidentiality, and I don't want my name out there.$Donate water filters or the money for water filters, write to your congressperson, vote for those who pledge to help and hold them accountable if they don't.$The president can authorize an infrastructure development plant to fix this. Paid for by taxpayers and subsidies granted to state and city. Reinvestment negotiations for employment and local labor force.
But no one gives a fuck. And this problem is not just Flint.
When the water resources (agricultural sources too) start drying out, we will fight for water. No one cares now. Except Nestle. They know what's coming and they are buying up all the water rights they can. And with a businessman as potus, this coming calamity will surely benefit Nestle and not the people. War will come. Not today, not tomorrow, but when the populace can no longer drink and eat. $Well. I'll tell you what I did with my own situation. My pipes were complete and utter dogshit. Probably at least 70 years old. I had them all replaced from the city main to my basement, and then had my plumbing redone. All of it. $11k. I used my savings and picked up a part-time job to pay for it.  

A person can sit around and bemoan their fate, or figure out what needs to be done and get to work. 

There's literally no money in Flint to retrofit people's homes and I don't see the state or federal government paying for it. 

At the very least I'd get a home filtering system in place.$Yep. That's nuts. We can only hope wherever we buy our own a house the water is safe..$To be fair, property values were essentially zero before all this.

https://www.trulia.com/real_estate/Flint-Michigan/market-trends/$>Now, the water is tainted and the property value must be essentially zero. 

I may be wrong, but I'm pretty sure a major part of the problem is that the property value was zero *before* the water problems. A GM plant closed in the 60s that basically employed the whole city. Then, for obvious reasons, the population dwindled. Like, half of the people moved away and crime became a huge issue - it's tiny, like fewer than 150k people tiny, and has still topped most dangerous city lists a few times. All before the water ever became an issue (by which I mean, the water became the issue it is today. Its clearly the end result of a very old problem).

If there's water problems somewhere that's doing well economically, that's thriving, it would be fixed. Flint has kind of been dying a slow, painful death for a while. Clean drinking water should be a basic expectation, but fixing piping in a crumbling city with no money isn't an easy fix. $This is a state and local government failure. $I'm sure that the people of flint are thinking the same thing $I can't believe this is in the US $[deleted]$Congratulations, you just created a strategy for politicians to move populations they don't like, companies to get no-bid contracts to move them from their friends in the government, and an incentive for state and municipal governments to repeat the mistakes and crimes that caused the Flint water crisis in the first place.$so then the federal government should control all local populations from the top level down, and abolish any towns that don't conform to their agenda?  basically get rid of local government and hand everything over to a central authoritarian federal government?  have you ever studied government or civics at all? $That's an extremely dangerous precedent to set. $> the city/state should be providing the residents with fair compensation for their moving expenses.

Where does the city and state get its money from? 

Thats the bitch of suing a government entity for money, its not the governments money, its our money.

Per wikipedia:
On December 9, 2016 the MDEQ reported more than 96 percent of water samples tested at high-risk Flint homes in November 2016 were below the federal lead threshold of 15 parts per billion.

So basically, all the water is safe to shower/bathe/wash dishes/water your garden with, but in 4% of the homes you should use a filter for water for drinking and cooking.

But people are still being given bottles water anyway. And that Flint isn't the only town in the US where Lead levels in the water are unacceptable and illegal.

If anything, maybe they should have mentioned in those Flint articles that this issue is not confined to Flint. There have been a few decent articles about other areas of the US with similar problems. The New York Times did a whole series in 2009 about water quality, but it would be nice to see more of these:

$Redditor here, I'm personally not all that concerned about the situation in Flint in light of everything that's happening in the world. Congress passed a budget giving them $170 million in aid. I'm not going to keep up on every step of the infrastructure progress. It's hard to enough just to keep up to date on what my own representatives are doing, not to mention what's happening internationally. $Not to mention NPR does stories on Flint quite often $But that's the mainstream media!!!!

3. Use the fund to undo these obscenely expensive disasters, and fall back on normal mechanisms for any remaining amount if necessary.$[deleted]$Flint has been run since democrats since at least the 1950s$> OK, Donny boy. You're in charge now. So whatcha gonna do to fix it?

Check my math on this, fam.  I'm right, right?

Obama hasn't fixed this problem since that date (April 24, 2014).
So, yeah.  I hope President Trump and Congress appropriate the funds; or if the fund have been appropriated, the contractors begin the replacement process.$This is a local government issue.

EDIT 6: Removed East Chicago info as I was mistaken as to the severity of the lead in the area.  Apparently mostly the soil in that area had a large amount of lead. While there was some lead found in the water in that area, it was isolated to the area in a housing complex.  From what I've found, there haven't been any reports of lead in the water in any other area of East Chicago.

EDIT 7:  Just messing with you.  Check out the East Chicago water gathering / testing that was done by TYT reporter Jordan Chariton:

Only want to mention that the cause of corrosion was mainly due to low pH, not just chlorides being present. The city failed to simply add corrosion inhibitors (which most water treatment facilities do, including Detriot's which previously supplied Flint). The state environmental agency, in a separate issue earlier in the year, found high levels of trihalomethanes which can lead to passive lead exposure when combined with lower pHs.

The city should have evaluated the water pH during the transition, but of course they do not have the proper technical expertise (chemists) present to have done it. Being a chemist, this infuriates me how easily it could have been avoided.

You can read more about it [here](http://cen.acs.org/articles/94/i7/Lead-Ended-Flints-Tap-Water.html%20).

EDIT: The main point I'm trying to make is that there's a reason why consulting exists, and whether government or private sector due diligence should be done when it comes to changing water sources for consumption.$[The Republican controlled house approved a $170 million dollar package to fix the pipes](http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2016/09/28/us-house-appears-reach-deal-flint-funding/91211890/)

$I'm not American so forgive me if this is a ridiculous question. Why does it seem like that anything nasty or obviously wrong that politicians do in the US is seemingly almost always done by the Republicans?$Yeah, it's the Republicans, guys.  Forget about the almost entirely Democratic local government because it can't be them.$You forgot that congress approved 170 million to fix the pipes and the construction is underway...

What else should we be doing?$I heard a report on the news last night that New Jersey has a problem now due to lead lined pipes. To go a little off topic the bridge connecting PA and NJ turnpikes is closed due to a structural crack. This is the infrastructure that is crumbling around all of us.$The second paragraph highlights the actual reason why the Flint Crisis lost coverage.

Multiple articles came out about all the other places with elevated lead problems. It became such a circus of "hey look at my lead poisoning, it's not just Flint" that the actual urgency and importance of the Flint Crisis waned. 

Basically, enough cities claimed to have lead problems that it became normal, in a sense. The sensationalism was taken out, and with it went the national attention and urgency.$Wow, this is eye-opening from a Canadian standpoint. That's all kinds of messed up.$Signed the petition... had 60k at the time 2 hours ago. Now has 1. Wtf?$That is really sad, but unfortunately true.

It's kind of why some people don't really care or know about terrorism in places like Turkey or Syria but they go apeshit when it happens in France or Germany.$I actually have it much better than many because I live near my parents who have well water. There are places all over to get free bottled water if it's needed and even home delivery in some cases. It's far from ideal because almost every day you will still see folks who don't have transportation lugging cases of water down the street. It's messed up and I count my blessings that I only have to drink bottled water and don't need to cook or wash up with it.$Yeah I'm curious too, how do these people live? Boil everything? Bottled water?!?!$Like a lot of people it's a combination of many things, family, finances and being stubborn has a lot to do with it, but I love this city and the people here.

We don't have much but it's ours and even when it's in a place of violence and poverty a lot of us still try to make the best of it.$You're going to have a difficult time selling a house in Flint. $Not a resident there but id imagine they have around 150-200k in mortage on a house that sells for 50k with situation like that.$Correct.

Now people are just permanently trapped there because their homes have no value anymore$The people living there may not be able to afford the cost of living in another town. $> There's expanding composite pipe for this type of job that goes in existing pipe and seals it back up

Can be done quickly and gets people water while the infrastructure is replaced over time. $They tries filters but the concentration of lead was so high that the filter would basically need to be replaced constantly. Which for the poor residents of Flint is not an option the best thing they can do to solve this is offer them the appraised value of their house plus whatever is determined to be the amount diminished by the lead piping. A similar problem happened in Centralia Pennsylvania.$> Donate water filters or the money for water filters

lmfao don't do this. they already hand them out for free.

That's the same department that was saying it was safe to drink, when it blatantly was not.$MDEQ has been shady af in their practices. I would not accept any of their reports as factual.$On a scale of 0 to "somebody poisoned the water hole" my expert opinion would be that there is a snake in your boot.$You should take advantage of the free water testing and find out $I saw [this](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-lead-testing/) article in another comment. Pretty terrifying that Flint doesn't even stand out in the map.$Just to let you know, so that you don't actually believe about the water, that article isn't about the water. It's about lead blood level rates. And in very very few of those cases is the source of lead the water. In the rare cases that it is, it's not the municipal supply, but the pipes in the home if the home is very old. Lead poisoning and high levels of lead in blood are almost always caused from lead paint and other environmental exposures not tied to water, and certainly not municipal supply.

So while the situation in Flint on the surface looks bad, it actually speaks to how far we have come because essentially everyone 3 or 4 decades ago would have much higher levels of lead in their blood due to lead paint, and leaded gasoline. Just breathing was much worse for you in terms of lead than drinking the water in flint. 

Led paint / Paint chips have been a problem for a while and we are working to eradicate it, but the situation in flint is noteworthy because it is a new source of lead contamination, and one that we can curtail and only came about due to government ineptitude.

The situation with Lead in Flint is actually only happening because the new water they are pumping in is too corrosive. It's pulling lead out of old pipes, not ideal by any means, but the lead situation will resolve on it's own as there is a limited amount of lead that can leach out of the pipes at the level. 

While the lead is bad, and we understand it and why it's bad, a potentially even larger issue is that they are actually delivering polluted water in the first place, so the lead is getting all the immediate press because people understand it, but the water being contaminated at the source (not from lead) is the larger problem.
$[deleted]$Yep buy everyone out like you said. Then we ship all (a lot) the homeless there and let them form a society with all the buildings and no law. It could be a great experiment to see what would happen. This is just a joke$which government,   local, county, state or federal?
$Living is a choice$*new*s$I'd argue that an ongoing health crisis is not "old news". $Its still bad in flint. As a matter of fact i just read an article today about 300 plumbers that are part of a union working there to install filters free of charge. $No one cares is the unfortunate truth, as long as the majority has what they need to be comfortable they don't need to worry but someone rich gets hit by a natural disaster and suddenly they a brave, strong heros. Them and their multi million dollar insurance pay out. $The water is normal, yes, but the damage done by the water has not been fixed. The water was never "full of lead"... the water was too acidic. That acidity wore away the protective coating of old lead pipes that drew the water into homes. The reason the water isn't drinkable isn't because the water is still contaminated in the source, it's because the pipes are still leaking lead into their drinking water. In order to fix the problem, all those pipes need to be replaced.

[Here's an article from October](http://www.mlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/10/why_flints_lead_pipe_replaceme.html) discussing why it's so expensive to replace all those pipes.$A month or 2 after Flint water news broke, we received a letter from the city with info on our local water supply. Most of the levels hadn't been tested in years. Just looked at the city site cuz I forgot all about it, most levels have been tested somewhat recently (2015) and passed; with exception to lead and copper, last tested in 2012 and in violation...no worries. /s I'm actually super pissed now$> Redditor here

Woah, you should do an AMA.$>  Congress passed a budget giving them $170 million in aid

But they didn't. The House approved the bill. Until the Senate does the same thing, its just talk.  There are no steps to follow on the infrastructure progress even if you wanted to because no funds have been allocated.

But I don't disagree with the larger point you're making. $In all fairness, that's a very reasonable response. The issue should be resolved at a local level. $Now I don't know anything about how the American government works, but is the cleanliness of water in Flint a problem at the federal level or should aybe the Michigan government or local government handle this?$And hey, the new head of the EPA said not too long ago that he wants to get rid of the EPA.

So yeah, the Republican controlled legislature approved it -- but only after the Democrats pulled out all the stops to make it happen. I have no problem celebrating both parties for the $170M -- but you only seem to celebrate one.$"cars"$[deleted]$Rather than gilding your silly ass, I gave $4 to the [FWF](http://www.unitedwaygenesee.org/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&id=5).

Awareness is the only tool I can use to help.$That wasn't really him drinking the water as much at it was him taking a sip.

I'm not saying the water isn't safe when filtered. I'm no expert, but I do trust them that that is the case. 

What I do know is that changing the pipes isn't a process that happens overnight, and the filters seem like a reasonable measure till that process is done.$So, does the city pay for the filters that have to be used to drink the water? If not, that sounds really terrible still. Even with a filter, Obama didn't really even do anything but wet his lips with that water. Very reassuring. $Yeah that's a huge sip there!  Lips touched wet and adoring press will call that a sip.  Very reassuring!  $he was paid by big filter for that whole video

^^^^^(/s)

no but for real, why didn't he fix this problem?$They took the water that residents are getting, added an extra stage of purification which doesn't exist in the municipal system, and he was clearly afraid to actually drink it. Barely touched his lips to the glass! Amazing.$Thanks for the link. 

>The city should have evaluated the water pH during the transition, but of course they do not have the proper technical expertise (chemists) present to have done it. 

I just want to point out that the city might not have had the authority here. They were in agreement with Ed Kurtz over the transition to the Flint River supply, but this decision had to be approved by the state, too. 

IIRC it was the Emergency Manager who arranged the contract with the engineering company to draw up the water, so one would think it also falls on him to test the water too. But I'm not positive of the regulations at play, here. Apparently no one was.

During this transition period, Flint went through three Emergency Managers. Ed Kurtz began the project in June. Michael Brown took over in July, then Darnell Early took over in October, all of that same year. It's possible that this weird shuffling of Emergency Managers caused it to slip through the cracks.$The current belief in this investigation is that the emergency manager vetoed spending approximately 50$ a day for corrosion protection to save money. I work at my municipalities water plant and adjusting pH while sometimes tricky to get correct is not as expensive as one may think.$That's unpossible. Everyone knows Republicans are the devil and only want poor people to die so they can eat them. $Under duress.  Democratic representatives had to force the issue, according to your article.

>It has been far from easy to get to this point. To even get Kildee's amendment in the House version of the WRDA, Senate Democrats led by Michigan's two members upended votes Tuesday to keep government open past the end of the federal fiscal year at midnight Friday if resolutions were going to include $500 million for flooding in Louisiana but no assurances for Flint.

>Faced with those votes, the House acted to find a place for Flint funding. Meeting late Tuesday night, the House Rules Committee let move forward Kildee's proposed amendment — providing $170 million in funding to help communities under an emergency declaration for lead in their drinking water, a provision that only applies to Flint at present — after only a day earlier rejecting a substantially similar amendment.$The one all Democrats voted for and had to drag Republicans to?

Wonder what was extorted this time.$well fucking yay for them doing the right thing 3 years later.$Of course they're also the ones that closed the investigation, blamed the EPA and Michigan department in general, and let the governor off the hook completely (despite him refusing to provide documents and witness statements that the committee demanded):

$> Why does it seem like that anything nasty or obviously wrong that politicians do in the US is seemingly almost always done by the Republicans?

I'm not positive but if I had to guess, I'd say it's a combination of the following:

1) Reddit is more liberal so we see them outraged at their political opponents more. Republicans are conservative, so Republicans will be targeted more.

2) Republicans, by arguing that government is inherently bad, self-select for those who are less capable at governing.

3) Republicans, by arguing that less government is better and personal interest will solve all, self-select for those who want to remove laws that protect others to benefit their personal self-interest. In other words, they self-select *public servants* into the Democratic Party, and political climbers (or those prone to corruption) into their own party.

4) Democrats are less unified than the Republicans, and are less likely to close ranks to protect their own when a scandal forms. This means that scandals from Democrats are over pretty quick, while Republican scandals become long, protracted partisan issues.$It doesnt seem like that to an objective reader. One of the emergency managers here was a Democrat, as were most of the city officials. But you fixated on the Republican Governor. 

For the past few months Democratic scandals and controversies have swamped the front page. Hillary Clinton, Debbie, the DNC, superdelegates, etc. The TPP was bipartisan, but its two biggest proponents were Clinton and Obama. 

The Democrats also rigged their primaries in favor of Clinton to prevent Bernie from being elected. This was widely publicized and admitted to by the DNC.

There have been many, very public scandals surrounding the Democrats, and many of the same by the Republicans. But a combination of your own bias and that of reddit has made you filter out the Democratic ones, assign blame to the individual instead of the party, and focus on Republican mistakes. $Republicans are stereotyped to be all about the wealthy.  They believe that everyone should look out for themselves and if someone is poor it's their own damn fault.  Democrats are thought of as being for the little man and stereotyped to wanting to baby the poor and take all the money from the rich. Democrats are blamed for lazy poor, Republicans blamed for being heartless.$Because you are on reddit which is heavily biased.$Its not, thats just all you hear about$You do know the mayor of Flint is a democrat right?

Want a recent shit thing happened by a liberal politician?

Obama before leaving office expanded spying by intelligence agencies even more than before.$Because all Republicans are evil. /s

Thanks for noticing this.  It's not, Democrat politicians and policies contribute their fair share of problems that you don't hear about as much.  This is the literally result of the liberal bias in the media.$If you think about what was said, you can see why it was actually reasonable. The governor is a Republican, so you can see why there'd be some bias involved, which might make you raise an eyebrow.

Your second thought should be "Wait, why would the state governor have anything to do with water quality in the city of Flint?"

The answer to that is "nothing". It's just a red herring.$A lot of it comes down to a biased media.

PS...it is the Republican Congress that approved 170 million dollars to fix this problem and is currently working on it....did you miss that article...ohhhh because shit like that doesn't get covered and when it does, it isn't making it to a visible spot on Reddit.

$OP here is blaming Republicans but not supporting his accusation. A more accurate question is why are Republicans always accused of being the bad guys?$It's not, that's just what you hear on reddit. Elsewhere the opposite will be true. You're talking about an event that happened under a democratic rule and somehow blaming republicans.$Mayor of Flint at the time of the switch from Lake water to river water was a Democrat - hence some dude near the top of  this thread blaming the Republican governor.$1. The passage of the Safe Drinking Water Act Improved Compliance Awareness Act by the federal government, thus mandating public awareness when lead levels are detected in drinking water, and to improve communication between State and Federal water regulators

2. A complete review of the EPA’s current Lead and Copper Rule provisions as it relates to the Flint lead crisis, as well as a clear statement from the federal, state and local government on their roles and responsibilities concerning these provisions, which should include requirements for rigorous testing and modeling of water when switching to a new water source

3. Improved access to childhood lead testing and an educational and assistance fund for children with permanent mental deficiencies resulting from lead poisoning$They wanted Obama to wave his magical President wand and fix all the pipes in town. That didn't happen and now the expensive and intensive process of actual repair is happening and it's taking longer than the person in the picture wanted. People on ~~reddit~~ the internet are reactionary and OP Pic Man wants to capitalize on it.$So why doesn't NJ do something about their infrastructure?$You would think that should've made it a bigger crisis.$I agree. At the same time anywhere with older pipes (yes, even Canada) can often have the same problem.

Wait, so the water is so polluted that people can't even shower with it and have been bird bath showering for nearly 3 years now with bottled water? $Bottled water. Also stores sell purified water. I just shower with  the water as it comes out. Its very highly chlorinated, and probably lead(Ed?). Oh well. I get cancer so be it. Nothing I can really do about it. Too poor to move. $If you boil water with lead in it and don't collect the steam as condensation... you still have water with lead in it. Unfortunately they have to advertise this on billboards in flint because people were doing that for a while. $According to the CDC, "Because some of the water evaporates during the boiling process, the lead concentration of the water can actually increase slightly as the water is boiled."

So yeah, bottled everything it would seem.$Nice words! I wish you and your family all the best!$But the water is literally poisoned. Water = Poison. How is that not enough motivation to move? I'm not from the US, please don't kill me for asking - but I really fail to understand why anyone would stay. I get that moving would be a very very hard thing to do for a lot of people, but it's not impossible. Everyone has a choice to take a chance on leaving. ELI5: why stay? $Sounds like they need a bailout.$I've worked on a CIPP (cured in place pipe) team that relined residential sewer pipe up to 8" in diameter.  There are companies out there that were doing large municipal pipes up to 4' at the time, but the process was still very much in its experimental phase and cost a metric fuck-ton of money.

Cities would be highly unlikely to invest in relining IMHO.  The liners often fail during installation when the existing pipe is in poor condition.  If they fail, they can be extremely difficult or even impossible to remove resulting in having to dig up the pipe anyway.$Except they speak the same language, have the same societal norms, are more or less the same color and have a government that *can* provide support for them if it felt like it.$~~Yes.~~ Right. $I mean if you can't get the job done go to the fed and ask for help.

As an employee of one of the companies cleaning it up I can assure you that if you live anywhere in the United States that your water isn't much better. I have seen violent levels of lead and no one says a word to the people. Even as much as 10x allowed legal limits of other contaminants, and the town makes efforts to sweep it under the table. $Several reasons.

1) "fixing" would require pretty much removing and replanting every single pipe in the county. That is expensive as hell, and takes forever, and there has been a serious battle in congress over funding.

2) Its a local problem that was caused under state government control. The federal government certainly has a responsibility to help, but why should the federal government foot the bill for the crisis and gain nothing. All that does is signify to other places that they can fuck shit up and the federal government will bail them out.

EDIT: changed "fit the check" to "foot the bill"$People do realize that people other than Barack Obama actually make decisions in our government, correct?$Because honestly it's a virtually impossible problem to fix. The logistics behind replacing the number of pipes they need to is [insane](https://www.wired.com/2016/01/heres-how-hard-it-will-be-to-unpoison-flints-water/). I think 60 million and 15 years is probably underestimating as well. Honestly it's probably cheaper just move everyone out to a new town than fix the issue.

tl;dr The government first has to find several HUNDRED MILES of service pipes, then dig 5-7 feet down to access them, then replace them. In an area whose temperatures range from highs in the 30's and 40's during the day and 10's/single digits at night during the winter.$It isn't his job.

Why didnt he get involved in that" (not that im targeting you specifically)  I feel like people expect him to dive in and draw up the plans to treat the water and replace the pipes himself or something. But thats just me and i dont really care enough about politics to look into what a president can actually do in that situation. $Ahhh makes sense.

Who has been in charge of the city for decades? Corrupt idiots.$>4) Democrats are less unified than the Republicans

While 2 and 3 are already biased, this just takes the cake. Nothing about that is true. The Democrats have long been a more unified party. The liberal wing of the Supreme court votes together much more than the conservative wing. The DNC exercises much more control over elections than the RNC, super-delegates being a prime example. The Democrats have a long history of being far more aggressive on the campaign trail in terms of getting their constituency to vote. For length of scandals, see point 1. It's not true, it's just how your media consumption patterns makes it appear.

Edit: Oh! I forgot about the Tea Party. The right is *not* unified.

Edit2: It looks like we're not using our vocab quite the same way. To clarity, I'm talking about organizational unity, not voter unity. The DNC and the Democrats in Congress are more unified than the RNC and the Republicans in Congress.$This is actually pretty accurate.$You know that the Republican state legislature passed laws to strip the democratically elected Democratic mayor from power and replace him by an Emergency Manager appointed by the Republican governor, right?$The Flint mayor didn't make the water decisions.  It was a state appointed emergency manager who made the recommendation to switch to the state government, who approved it without corrosion protection.  You can blame the mayor if you want because you clearly didn't research it.$The mayor of New Orleans was a Democrat, as well.

So, the press blamed the President.  Who had nothing to do with the shitty state of New Orleans' levies.

It's very much like corporate IT. A lot of companies will shit on their IT department because they don't generate any revenue, are always costing money for high-cost components, and you only ever call or hear from them when something goes wrong.

This one point is also a large part of why they lost this time

$Yea this past year really shows how unified Democrats are.$More unified lol , the whole giving questions illegally to hillary to screw bernie was unification 101$> The Democrats have long been a more unified party. 

I think it's interesting you believe that. All of the 2016 faithless electors were Democrats, for example, and I believe that Paul Ryan has spoken often about how unified the Republican party is behind Trump now that he's won. And yet, during the primary...

>The DNC exercises much more control over elections than the RNC, super-delegates being a prime example.

... They literally cancelled the election in Colorado because Trump might win. To me, that's the grade A example of Republicans closing ranks around their own. They did everything in their power to stop an outsider until he was an insider, and then they rallied around him. Priebus -- who was head of the RNC -- is now Trump's Chief of Staff.

I'm also not sure how you could say that the DNC intervenes more than the RNC considering that fact. I'm *also* not sure how super delegates are an example of the Democrats being unified. Aren't half the democrats railing against them because they view them as unfair and undemocratic? Didn't they *come to exist* because of the historic divisions within the Democratic Party (IE, the 1968 riots in Chicago and the crushing loss to Nixon?)

At the same, the Democrats are still fighting over who is in control of the party, and have been since the election began.

I don't think your claim is backed by the evidence you've provided in the slightest.

Don't get me wrong, what is happening in Flint and the blind eye that we've turned to it thus far is horrific, I just see this as a solution that is addressing a symptom of a larger problem.  

EDIT- I guess i worded that poorly, my point was that we should be taking larger steps toward fixing our dangerously outdated infrastructure.  I was not suggesting that we should not be doing so, I was asking if we thought that this sort of aid was going to be more widely available to the other 30+ cities that are in a similar predicament.  If essential infrastructure isn't a priority, what exactly are we paying taxes for? $Sure.  The city manager and his buds should go to jail.  But that doesn't solve the current problem.

It's not all "the people get what they want," there's a very powerful effect that goes the other way: the people want what they get.$Maybe divert some of those DoD dollars to shoring up America's infrastructure? $Exactly.

Lead isn't a new problem, but the idiots in Flint and Michigan made it much worse by removing the protective layers of crud that sealed in the lead before.

Now it's just clean pipes leaching lead.

The answer is to dig up every lead pipe and replace it with steel or PVC.  Which is a huge task, and also, requires a lot of money.

He had to go back two days later, but he was able to bury his brother and be with the family. They did the same thing for a friend who went into early labor while her husband was deployed; he was able to be with his daughter for her very short life because of Red Cross.

Belts do fuck all.$No, nothing really changed

Nerd-centric hobbies always have a fair share of these types of things, which is unfortunate but not too terribly more common than any other setting 

I go to mtg tournaments often and I rarely notice crack, likely because I don't go around staring at waist level, but I have seen some offenders. It's unfortunate but ultimately not a huge issue IMO.

The main thing that sucks, and likely the true cause of the ban (which they claimed was bullying), is that it paints a bad picture of mtg players for outsiders. We already get the neckbeard stereotype enough, so stuff like this doesn't help.

I, like many other mtg players, found the post hilarious despite the minor embarrassment for the community$The statement from WotC (the governing body) was something along the lines of 'we accept all body types'. They also recently banned a rapist who was released and completely rehabilitated a decade ago, purely because he got too much spotlight from the professional scene. $Seriously, the wise cracks are getting old.$That table would collapse from anybody else standing on it but it knows to suck it up and not be a lil bitch when The Legend is posing$I guess they don't like crackheads.$[deleted]$Or, person who understands basic civility and attire documents lack of understanding in gaming community.$It's hilarious how this is big news on reddit.$18 months is like 50 years on the Internet. $It felt like 18 months.$Yeah felt more like a year and a half$It felt like years... He's been gone too long :($Ostrasizing a large ^*large* part of the community, it didn't sit well with WotC. Not saying I agree with the ban but it's not hard to see where they were coming from.$The people who give you money to go to your tournament typically don't want to have their ass photographed and put on the internet without their knowledge. I know what you're going to say: THEN THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE THEIR ASS HANGING OUT. That's a stellar response, but the tournament still doesn't want their players photographed and put on the internet without their knowledge. $The answer is that WotC is protecting their bottom line. They saw it as bad business to offend the very demographic buying their product. 
$It's brutal as fuck.  You wouldn't like that happening to you, right?  These guys went to a Magic tournament, not a Critique My Fashion And Fitness tournament.  

That being said, I laughed so hard I could hardly breathe when I saw the post.  I'm sure the wotc guys did too, but that can't be their public face.  A temp ban was appropriate, and 18 months struck me as a bit too long, but they had to do SOMETHING.  There's a lot of wacky looking guys at Magic tournaments, without some action, why go?  None of them left the house that morning with "I'd like my ass crack to be an internet punchline for the entirety of the current epoch", after all.$because either they mad or nah but this case they mad$Well the Government didn't ban him... so as far as Constitutional Rights (or other similar rights) go none were violated
$The definitive proof that there is no room left for the uncorrupted gaming journalist.$IF you were looking for a serious response to that question: https://xkcd.com/1357/$Which universe do you live in where reddit is vehemently anti-taking pictures without permissions. Do you not remember the massive support of creepshots and the fappening?$The thing is that all of them are faced the other way and it would be really hard to tell who they are.$I have a theory that there are actually multiple people on reddit, each with their own beliefs. Call me crazy, but that may explain why conflicting opinions may coexist here.$The rest of the players, who didn't want their asscracks on the internet, likely would enjoy going to that tournament and knowing that they can play without their asscracks on the internet.

I foresee a lot of responses of "WELL THEN THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE THEIR ASSCRACK HANGING OUT." but that doesn't change the fact that the people who go to these tournaments want to believe that if their ass escapes, they don't want it photographed and put on the internet to entertain mouth-breathing redditors. 

Why this response to his photographs bewilders anybody is a true mystery.

edit: Thanks for the responses; there was some genuinely interesting points raised, but I have to go grade some papers for my students who hopefully aren't exposing their asscracks, so I won't be responding anymore or reading anymore replies.

He didn't post a single picture!$I really would have thought the top rated posts of all time would be a little less, you know, lame.$I'll never understand why that montage parody post was so highly upvoted.$Careful, you crack one joke here and you start a whole damn pun thread$He got banned for taking some pictures of ass cracks?? $He got banned for posting the thread$Yes, a tournament that relies on people attending should certainly not ban a guy who took a bunch of photos that mocked the people who are attending that tournament. You obviously have sharp business acumen and I see great dividends being paid in your future.

Asscracks come out of pants sometimes. You could either inform that person, ignore it, or photograph it and let the entire internet gawk at a bunch of people's asscracks without their knowledge. Only the redditor believes that the third option is the best and bereft of any ethical issues.$I'm glad I could help, my friend.

Man, that was an ass for the ages.$Just because he was banned from participating doesn't mean he wasn't allow to be in attendance. $If not, it should have been. Shame is really useful sometimes.$Still doable.$It's big news because his original post was funny as hell. $I also like to get my news from /r/pics$Jesus so AOL is like 800 years old? Yoda, I must fucking be.$No it's more like 3 days. Time just blends together and you don't even notice how long it has been. $More like 18 months.$Much like "Deflategate", they pulled his 18 month punishment out of their ass.  He mocked their fans and aired their dirty laundry in public.

No, it wasn't hard to see where they're coming from.  But while WotC seemed to have a stick up their ass about this "offense", the community was largely split.  What it uncovered was that the assholes at WotC would rather worry more about their fan base being exposed to ridicule than identify the real issue.  They need to put on their big boy pants and deal with the fact that a lot of their players can't be bothered to dress appropriately.  Even acting on this fact in hindsight is better than shooting the messenger.  They could have gotten behind their fans and nudged them all to improve themselves.  They could have tooted their own horn about how they didn't crack down on him but created a positive outcome from it all instead.

Instead, he's able to make them the butt of the joke yet again.

EDIT:   Thanks for the golden booty.$I mean fat people don't necessarily show crack. These people just didn't dress properly.$"So, ah, are we just not gonna talk about the Grand Prix smell...?"$People really need to learn to laugh at themselves and not take things so seriously. That, or pull up their pants when they sit down. Maybe both.$Nothing like bringing your kid to a tournament and having them exposed to large smelly mens asscracks (16 of them no less) and then if you do anything about it or say anything about it you get banned for harassing those men. $Sadly overweight slobs make up too large a portion of the Magic community to risk offending them.$Dude, if your ass crack is hanging out, you're ostracizing yourself.

It's not like it's some skinny blonde chick pointing and laughing at nerdy dudes in some cruel condescension.

It's one dude, pointing and laughing at his peers, who are grown men that can't dress themselves in properly fitting attire when they go into public.


$Welcome to the streisand effect, Wizards.$Maybe they should ban being disgusting slobs from WotC?$> Not saying I agree with the ban but it's not hard to see where they were coming from.

It kind of is. In what world is it okay to defend people caring so little about exposing themselves in this kind of setting?

It's absolutely appalling.$If photos weren't permitted, the event would have said so.

He got banned for bullying/belittling/humiliating people, which makes sense. A Magic event is supposed to be a "safe space" for players (even if they don't call it that), so I can see why Wizards would take this buttcrack expose so seriously.

I both greatly appreciate his contribution to the world of found art, AND understand why he would get banned from continuing to hone his craft.$It's like a weird Jekyll and Hyde thing. On one hand, everyone really wanted naked pictures of celebrities. On the other hand, everyone knew that shit was just plain wrong. 

Same goes for shots of random people posted without their permission. 90% of any random thread would either villify or cheer the OP but you really never know which way it's going to go until you actually post it.

Edit: Didn't actually change anything.

Edit 2: is it ironic that 5 out of 6 replies to this post are about how non-homogenous reddit is? I'm not sure.

Edit 3: 6 out of 7. 85% percent of people choosing to respond to this post have made exactly the same statement. Way to prove your point there folks.

Edit 4: No I'm not trying to argue that everyone on reddit has the same opinion. That's dumb. I'm saying individual threads tend to turn into echo chambers and it's difficult to predict which flavor of reddit you're going to get in any given thread.$Exactly, and buying a belt isn't exactly hard...$WELL THEN THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE THEIR ASSCRACK HANGING OUT$This was not a simple, isolated event of an asscrack "escaping." This was full-blown asscrack NEGLECT.$Yeah, you nailed it.  WotC would side with the other players because they'd rather defend this than try to say "Well, if you could wear appropriate clothing ...and shower every morning" but that would get them into heaps of trouble (mostly from blowback of players).

The most they could do is put 'please wear appropriate clothing' on their pamphlets.  But even then if they tried to specify clothing that covers ass cracks, i mean...is there enforcement.

"Excuse me...your crack is showing...BUMBLEBEETUNA!"

There's a line that WotC would rather not cross.$Butt fuel can't melt steel memes$Dank. Just like his buttcrack.$As an engineer, I have to tell you that you're flat out wrong and are, quite frankly, a moron. As an engineer, it has been shown time and time again that there are in fact Engineers of the highest class here on reddit. If you're taking a biology class at a community college, you are automatically qualified to address yourself as a Biological Engineer. If you are an electrician who has worked on a few house projects, then you work in Structural Engineering. If you are well on your way of getting a computer science degree and have taken a few programming classes and understand programming logic jokes on reddit, you are a Software Engineer. I'm telling you, as an Engineer, there are engineers on reddit. $R$From knowyourmeme.com:

>"damn you", in the sense of internet culture, is a humorous derivative of the properties of dams. By telling someone "damn you" on the internet you essentially tell a person to build an imaginary dam to contain their rapid flow of bullshit. This internet idiom was created among Dutch netizens on hagelslag.nl[1] in early 2005 to make a  mark on the internet. This is one of the earliest known Dutch contributions to humor on the internet.

EDIT: Woah guys, alright, maybe it's not that hard to find correctly fitting pants. I'm just trying to see the issue from the other side. I'm personally not overweight, so you guys can stop telling me to buy a belt or go to the gym.

It's just unawareness or laziness on their part (I like to believe the former because yeah...)$This is not really an excuse. With the internet, it's easier than ever to find clothes to fit over fatness.

As you may have gathered from my username, I am fat. I am big fat bastard. I can't recall a time when strangers didn't call me "big guy". And yet, my ass does not hang out of my clothing.

The key to avoiding asscrackery is that you have to come to terms with your fatness, and wear jeans/pants that fit your *waist*, not your hips. If I wore my jeans under my gut, I could drop at least 10 inches off my waist size. But those would slide down and show asscrack when seated.

I suspect these asscrackers just don't want to come to terms with their fatness. No, dude, you are *not* a 38 inch waist anymore, you're a 48 inch waist. Go buy some pants that fit.$I've been clean for years (of magic, I'm hygienic in general), and I swear I could smell the freshly-opened booster pack just now.$That new, "eco-friendly" packaging they were trying out for a while just doesn't hold the new card smell the same way, though.

Even if you live on nothing but chips and junk, that doesn't mean you automatically become obese; it's all about how many calories you're consuming.

Also, I doubt 4000 calories a day of junk food is that much cheaper than 2000 calories a day of normal food. You may get more calories per buck when buying junk food, but obese people should be reducing their calorie consumption anyway. $Wow, no. Recently changed my diet to mostly whole foods and I cook alot more, way cheaper. The cost comes in being lazy and paying someone else to cook your food. You have time to cook if your playing Magic. $It's not relevant. He's just a recovering addict.$Of course the username is relevant, he made the account just for this comment.$Found the enabler.$Fuck you I've been clean for 6 months....

I like to imagine him making a deck for his parents and making them learn the rules, just so he could play with them and share the news that way.$NSFW guys, incase you couldn't guess.$you're saying they can't tell that their ass crack is showing? $[deleted]$Similarly, my time spent in retail hell (read : Gamestop) also had a consistently smelly customer base. At one point we had a female customer wrinkle her nose and ask "What's that smell?" to which Austin replied by taking a large whiff of the air and exhaled it with the word "Gamers." $I like a wise crack but I like a wise crack's butt crack even more. To be fair of course.$Yea, he never broke character during his buttcrack crusades. $[deleted]$I lost over sixty pounds eating McDonald's 4-5 times a week, but also running 12-18 miles a week. Yep, it's about the calories.$> You can eat McDonalds for every meal and still lose weight.

Use case right here.  Ate at McDonalds for dinner every day when I was losing weight.  Lost 90 pounds.  It was easy to do, because I knew how many calories I was consuming since they were listed.  Cheap as hell too.$It is true that it is the calories but you feel a lot less full after 500 calories of shitty food vs 500 calories of balanced food, so it is natural to eat more shitty food to feel full.$So this is partially true. Yes weight loss is calories in < calories out, but the food you eat can affect your basal metabolic rate. Sugar in particular tends to have a greater effect than greasy burgers though. McDonald's will probably just give you high blood pressure and a heart attack, but yes you can lose weight.$Yeah, but laziness plays into it as well. You can't just grab an apple and eat it right out of the package like you can with a donut.$> a box of doughnuts will run you at least $10.

what kind of doughnuts are you buying?$This is the same kind of guy that will offer an alcoholic *just ooooooone beer*.$Now allow me to suggest how cool those new full art lands would look *if they were foiled*.$R$Y$needs more butt crack$you'll never make me click on an ebaums world link!$Most of these people have so much ass that keeping track of it all is a full time job$I don't know what it is about those people, did no one ever tell them?
